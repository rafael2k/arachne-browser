# Arachne Web Browser

## Introduction

Arachne is an Internet suite for DOS, consisting of a
graphical web browser, email client, dialer and some
other components. It was released first in 1996 for DOS,
with Linux beta support added in 2001.

The Arachne core source code has been released as
open source (GPLv2) with version 1.73 in 2003.

The LOPIF graphics library for DOS source code is
provided under the terms of GPLv2 (or later).
See lopif/copying.txt.

## Installation

### DOS

You will need a copy of Borland C++ 3.1 to build the source code.
Cross-compilation is not supported, but DOSBox can be used.

Download and install the [Arachne v1.99;GPL](https://www.glennmcc.org/arachne/a199gpl.zip)
DOS package. Earlier versions may also work.
Installation is straight-forward, just follow the installer instructions.

Open the CORE.PRJ (386+), CORE-086.PRJ (PC/XT) or
CORE-!87.PRJ (no FPU) project file and select
"Compile > Build all". After compilation is finished,
replace CORE.EXE with the new version.

### Linux / BSD

To build the SDL2 version, run "make" from the "sdl2" directory.

To build the SVGALIB version, run "make" from the "svgalib" directory.

I have not created a package for the support files (fonts,
icons, user interface, help and configuration files) yet,
so you need to install them manually. Start by downloading
the [Arachne GPL v1.95;GPL](https://www.glennmcc.org/aralinux/arachne-svgalib-1.95.tgz)
Linux package.

**Do not run the install script from the archive.**

**Do not run the arachne-install script, either.**

Extract the following files from the package:

```
   man/man1/arachne.1                  -> /usr/share/man/man1/
   doc/arachne/html/*                  -> /usr/share/doc/arachne/html/
   share/arachne/gui/*                 -> /usr/share/arachne/gui/
   share/arachne/ikons/*               -> /usr/share/arachne/ikons/
   share/arachne/iso-8859-1/*          -> /usr/share/arachne/iso-8859-1/
   share/arachne/iso-8859-2/*          -> /usr/share/arachne/iso-8859-2/
   share/arachne/mime.conf             -> /usr/share/arachne/mime.cfg
   share/arachne/templates/toolbar.cfg -> /usr/share/arachne/toolbar.cfg
   share/arachne/templates/entity.cfg  -> /usr/share/arachne/entity.cfg
```

Edit your new /usr/share/arachne/mime.cfg (**note the new file name**):

* in [MIME], replace the image/jpeg, image/png and image/x-png entries:

```
image/jpeg               JPG>BMP|convert $1 bmp3:$2
image/png                PNG>BMP|convert $1 bmp3:$2
image/x-png              PNG>BMP|convert $1 bmp3:$2
```

* in [ARACHNE], replace the .jpg, .jpe and .png entries:

```
file/.jpg            >BMP|convert $1 bmp3:$2
file/.jpe            >BMP|convert $1 bmp3:$2
file/.png            >BMP|convert $1 bmp3:$2
```

Create an initial configuration file in $HOME/.arachne/arachne.cfg:

```
# Arachne configuration
HomePage http://www.frogfind.com
Multitasking No
HTTPKeepAlive No
```
