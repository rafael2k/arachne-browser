1.66 stable for DOS, beta for Linux/SVGAlib and Linux/GGI
----

Release date: 20th July 2000
   Bug fixes: Serious security hole in both DOS and Linux version was fixed.
              Detailed description of this hole won't be pubished until all
              Arachne users upgrade to version 1.66 or later.
              COM port documentation error on Arachne setup screens.
              clear-cache.dgi in DOS version was working only in DR-DOS only.
              Configuration wizard was experiencing serious troubles when 
              TEMP directory setting was invalid.
	      PostScript output module was added to Linux version (Ctrl+P)
        Note: 1.65 beta for Linux was skipped because of known bugs in 1.65

1.65 stable for DOS
----

Release date: 18th July 2000
   Bug fixes: Serious crash of DOS version, when <FRAMESET> formated like eg.
              "800,*" was resulting in frame sizes smaller then zero in
              modes like 640x480 or 800x600 with sidebar. Totaly fixed, and
              as a side effect, all zero-sized frames are now made invisble
              to speed up page loading process.
              Serious crash of DOS version on pages with GIF images wider
              than 2048 pixels was fixed (eg. table background on Goto.com)
              Table layout was improved (pes.eunet.cz, www.freeuk.com, etc.).
              Unterminated HTML entity hack: "something & something" won't
              be formated like "something &something" any longer. Now GIF
              width is limited to 1200 pixels, but Arachne won't crash on
              wider GIFs.
              Memory model problems with DOS version were resolved, so
              images shouldn't disappear when DOS memory is running low.
     Changes: As requested by long-time Arachne users, modem configuration
              dialogues and ARACHNE.CFG variables were changed. Accepted values
              for ARACHNE.CFG variable "Port" are now 0 to 4, where
              1 to 4 are very standard serial ports (see PPP configuration
              page for details), while "Port 0" is any non-standard serial
              device, like "COM 3/IRQ 5" internal modems, etc. Base address
              must be always specified for those non-standard devices.
              Arachne now never writes "COMx" to PPPDRC.CFG file used
              by EPPPD.EXE, but always writes IRQ/Base address co
              ARACHNE.CFG variables "IRQ" and "Base" are now ignored for
              ARACHNE.CFG variable "Port" values 1 to 4, and accepted
              only for ARACHNE.CFG variable "Port 0".
              Another important incompatibility with older versions of
              Arachne is change in binary format of arachne.pck and
              cache.idx (in Linux, these are files stored in ~/.arachne).
              ASCII codes 128 to 159 are no longer hidden, so users will
              see whatever is located on these positions in font set (this
              range is not standard part of ISO-8859-x character sets, IMHO).
              ISO-8859-1 and ISO-8859-2 fonts of size 1 (all styles) were
              somewhat "squeezed" to get more Netscape/MSIE-like layout of
              resizable tables.
              Process of cleaning cache was now separated from main executable
              to script file (in DOS version, it is SYSTEM\DGI\CLR.BAT) so it
              can be customized.
Improvements: <SELECT> tag (pulldown menu) now can be controled comfortably
              even without mouse, using arrows, PgUp, PgDn, Enter and Esc.
              DOS version should be somewhat faster, because dependencies
              between overlaid modules were reduced - pages with JPEG images
              should load faster now.
              Setup of DOS version now should run correctly on any machine
              with at least 500 KB of DOS memory. Users have to manualy
              enter individual setup steps, if they don't have at least
              560 KB of memory available.
              Linux Arachne is now available in two versions, with graphics
              output using either SVGAlib or GGI - see GGI installation
              notes in file doc/arachne/README and on Arachne homepage.
              Both executables are included in Arachne package because of
              their small size. Arachne installation script creates
              special startup command /usr/bin/arachne, which launches
              SVGAlib version if $TERM=linux (linux console), and GGI version
              in other cases (like when arachne is started from xterm).
              Additionaly, users who have KDE installed in "/usr" hierarchy
              will get two nice Arachne icons (GGI for everyone, and SVGAlib
              for root, as only root can launch SVGAlib applicaions from X11)
              in their start menu. GNOME users must open KDE submenu; somehow,
              I haven' figured out where global GNOME menu configuration is
              stored - any help would be appreciated !

1.64 stable for DOS, beta for Linux
----

Release date: 6th July 2000
   Bug fixes: Numerous memory leaks, buffer overruns, etc. in both DOS and
              Linux version were fixed.
              More sizeof(int)!=2 related bugs were fixed in 32bit
              (currently only Linux) version.
              Bug fixes and optimizatons contributed by Emmanuel Marty from
              Suntech, France were merged with Arachne Labs codebase.
              Arachne now correcty displayes lists embeded in table cells.
              Linux version of Arachne now correctly displayes transparent
              GIFs - this problem was related to (char) != (unsigned char)...
     Changes: Arachne adjusts table sizes if you abort image download, which
              is important when browsing websites which include temporarily
              inaccessible images (remote hit counters, etc.)
              Handling of redirection, cookies and HTTP referer was slightly
              modified, which should increase Arachne compatibility with
              various sites which use cookies and with Microsot IIS websites.
              DOS Arache now won't write COM port number to PPPDRC.CFG file,
              which should help DOSPPPD to work better (not really tested...)
              Directory structure of Linux version of Arachne was changed
              to conform Unix traditions (bin/, share/arachne, doc/arachne).
              Configuration file for Linux Arachne is now expected to be
              ~/.arachne/arachne.conf. Arachne creates ~/.arachne/ directory
              structure when user launches it for the first time.
              Linux Arachne won't use APM packaging system, because of
              generally smaller size of entire package, and because there
              are numerous well-knon utilies available in most distributions
              Linux. Linux Arachne is distributed with both iso-8859-1 and
              iso-8859-2; charset can be changed using arachne.conf variable
              "FontPathSuffix".
Improvements: Arachne should render and display pages with tables generaly
              faster and in more usable manner, but also more Netscape-like,
              ie. tables won't be displayed until they are adjusted. This
              behaviour is user-cofigurable by hidden ARACHNE.CFG variable
              "QADT Yes" (Quick And Dirty Tables), which forces old-style
              approach to page preview.
              Arachne now correctly displayes ordered lists (<OL> .. </OL>).
              Linux Arachne can now use three HiColor resulutions using
              arachne.conf variable "GraphicsMode" - values are currently
              HI.I, HI.J, and HI.K.
              Linux Arachne is now distributed with relatively comfortable
              installation script, which is trying to check for system
              components which are required to sucessfuly run Arachne.

1.63 alpha
----

       Notes: Internal alpha-version. Never released to public, because
              number "3" looks ugly using Arachne 3D fonts ;-)


1.62 stable for DOS, alpha for Linux
----

Release date: 7th June 2000
   Bug fixes: Link from "Utilities" page to "Quickpad" was fixed.
              When attaching files, Arachne will return to correct page.
              Small cosmetical bugs when highlighting small icons.
              Correct error message is displayed when cache is full
              or incorrectly specified in ARACHNE.CFG
              Many serious bugs were found and fixed while working on
              Linux port, because Linux is much more strick about memory
              exceptions then even QEMM memory manager for DOS. DOS version
              now seems to be more stable than before, but maybe it is only
              my feeling...
     Changes: 16bit DOS, Linux and other versions of Arachne now share
              the same code base. Since now, all filenames in Arachne
              package will be related to as lowercase, with slash-separated
              directories.
              More enviroment space is available in Dos Shell (Alt+E)
              More news from Canadian front: Clarence Verge has designed
              "seriously looking Arachne Logo". Together with "seriously
              looking icons", it is now available as 1st alternative "skin
              APM" on Arachne download page. "Seriously looking icons" are
              no longer default part of Arachne WWW browser, which reduces
              size of basic Arachne package.
              Arachne now recognized charset name even when it is sent in
              HTTP header, and charset found in HTTP header has higher
              priority than charset found it <META HTTP-EQUIV...> tag.
              New miniterm.exe was included,  with modem timeout increased
              from 1 to 2 minutes - some 56kbps modes are handshaking fore
              more than minute (!) at least on low quality lines. Timeout
              should be in fact configurable as arachne.cfg variable called
              "Timeout", but this was not tested.
              Sample ACF profiles in package now shouldn't include
              meaningless sample login scripts.
Improvements: For the first time, both Linux and DOS builds of Arachne were
              released ! It requires SVGAlib to run, more details in
              separate README.Linux file.
              Arachne has new 88x31 icon (examples/arachne.gif).
              Arrachne 1.62 requires 9 KB less conventional DOS memory than
              version 1.61, as a result of quite careful code-optimizing
              diet; this size reduction should continue in future, as there
              is always some bloat to be removed...
     Warning: Linux version is alpha, preview, demo, simply dysfunctional!!!
              It violates segmentation all the time, it's extremely unstable
              and unusable. It's not intended to be useful, it's just
              technology demonstration!

1.61 stable release
----

Release date: 27th March 2000
   Bug fixes: Arachne won't crash when illegal <TD BACKGROUND=""> or tag
              <BODY BACKGROUND=""> (with empty argument) occurs.
              Arachne now correctly detects missinig local files
              of unknown type, so error screen is displayed instead of
              "save as" dialogue.
              Small bug fix in HTML layout (necessary to correctly display
              new HTML layout of www.wired.com ;-)
              APM package manager works again.
              More than 4 files/e-mails can be now marked for deletion ;)
     Changes: Source code of UNARJ.EXE was linked with APM.EXE, so modified
              UNARJ binary is no longer included in main Arachne package.
              When pressing Enter inside block, block is unmarked.
              File "about.htm" was corrected: Clarence Verge, author of
              file "keywords.txt", is from Canada, not from USA ;-)
              (like Terrance and Philip ;-)
Improvements: Newer version of ODIPKT.COM was included to Arachne package,
              together with some documentation - running Arachne on top
              of Novell networks should be easier now.
              Little speed improvement thanks to more overlay and cache
              directory optimization (.htt files with HTTP headers has
              moved to separate CACHE\HEADERS\ subdirectory, which
              increased loading of pages from full cache by 25-50% percent).
              Additional, ARACHNE.CFG variable "KeepHTT No" optionaly disables
              writing .htt files at all, which can improve performance of
              Arachne especialy on systems, where internet connection is
              faster than performance of file systen. (GUI control can
              be found on "Desktop | Options | Internet")

1.60 STABLE RELEASE
----

Release date: 17th March 2000
   Bug fixes: Setup screen VGA.HTM was badly designed so it hasn't worked
              when line with resolution was located above line with card
              type... (sorry ;-)
              mailto: style URLs in clipboard can be added to Hotlist
              without problems again.
              Link to hotlist manager works again (MIME.CFG was broken).
              Ugly block highlighting in single line windows was fixed.
              Broken pasting of blocks to single-line windows works again.
Improvements: New ARACHNE.CFG variable "VFAT Yes|No" (also Desktop | Options
              | Local settings) allows viewing of localy stored websites
              using Win 9x long filenames, but only in Windows DOS box.
              File extension .eml (M$ Outlook mail messages) is now treated
              the same way as .cnm (Pegasus Mail for DOS, Novell, Arachne).

1.60 beta 2
----

Release date: 16th March 2000
   Bug fixes: Small bugs and typos in local HTML files and in MIME.CFG
              Scroll history for all types cached pages works again.
              Mouse initialization and Tab/Shift+Tab navigation when
              no mouse driver is loaded.
              Broken 16-color-VGA/EGA/experimental-CGA support was fixed.
              AltSysFont (needed eg. for Cyrillic support) works again.
              Missing background images on certain table or frames based
              pages were fixed. It was happening when width of table
              cell of frame was EXACTLY identical to with of background
              image. Side effect of this bug fix is speed improvemnt.
              Detection of corrupted GIFs was adjusted to be more tolerant,
              so certain 16 color GIFs which used to be ignored are now
              being displayed correctly.
              Certain problems with multiple <TD ROWSPAN>1> cells were fixed.
              Some minor problems with mouse initialization were (probably)
              fixed.
     Changes: ARACHNE.CFG variable FastJPEGs and pseudo-MIME-type
              fastimage/jpeg are obsolete. They were replaced by MIME.CFG
              macro "$j", which expands into optional "-colors 256" string +
              content of ARACHNE.CFG variable JPEGargs.
              Thanks to Bernie, Arachne is now shipped with 32bit version
              of DJPEG by default. Alternative package with 16bit version
              is available (with no-HiColor version of CORE.EXE)
              The same stands for fastfile/* and LocalIcons; were replaced
              by ARACHNE.CFG variable FILEargs and MIME.CFG macro "$f".
              MIME.CFG should be more readable and logical now.
              WWWMAN.EXE was changed because of that.
              Different Cookie handling while redirection - not sure if
              it will help or not, it is still not compatible with
              certain sites.
              Arachne now ignores all spaces at the end of URL, which
              is what other browser do too. However, it is not documented
              anywhere and it should be consider to be one of "dirty tricks"..
              Mouse clicks in text fields are now used to mark and
              manipulate blocks. See editor help and Arachne Hotkeys page.
              Now you can select multiple e-mail messages or local files
              with right mouse buton and then delete them using Del key.
Improvements: Slightly extended documentation of certain features.
              Higher quality of JPEG conversion in "FastJPEGs" mode, and
              higher speed of JPEG conversion even in HiColor modes (DJPEG.EXE
              is same, but Arachne provides it with better command line
              arguments). Arachne Packet Driver Wizard was finished - TCP/IP
              setup was made more easy to understand for newbies.
              Arachne now recognizes <FRAMESET [FRAME]BORDER="false"|"no"|"0">
              tag for disabling borders of all frames.
              Copy & paste in text input fields (<TEXTAREA> tag) was
              finaly implemented.

1.60 beta 1 - "millenium pre-release"
----

Release date: 16th January 2000
       Notes: 1.50 stable release was skipped due to release of new version of
              WATTCP library.
   Bug fixes: Installation utility was completely rewritten once again and
              it should be more stable and usable now.
              Many types of table rendering bugs were fixed - including
              nested tables, multicolumn cells and table alignent.
              (see new examples\tables.htm file).
              Insight was upgraded to version 3.5, which fixes certain bugs
              with attaching files and "Cannot create index file" bug.
              (It was caused by TEMP variable finished by "\", which is
              illegal. Both INSIGHT.EXE and CORE.EXE can handle this now,
              but there is still some garbage screen output from ARACHNE.BAT)
              Some of "infinite cycling" problems should be solved now (two
              of them - one was "cycling in frames" bug, second was caused
              by strange behaviour of some mouse drivers after initialization).
              Table rendering should be faster (after removal of certain
              unnecsary loops I found in my code) and more stable (after
              finding that one global variable should be rather strictly
              local in every function ;-).
              Target for <META HTTP-EQUIV="Refresh" ...> tag is "_parent",
              not "_top" (this is not realy bug-fix, but rather "Netscapism" ;)
              <META HTTP-EQUIV="Refresh" ...> now works even in fullscreen
              mode, as well as screensaver timer.
              Another Netscapism: underscore ('_') mustn't be converted
              to hexa code in CGI query strings (why ???)
              Mouse shouldn't be jerky any more, even on huge pages with
              frames and table... at least if download was already finished.
              There was error when accessing http servers on other port than
              80 via proxy - it is fixed now.
              Little bug in INSIGHT.EXE quoted-printable encoding was
              fixed: ASCII codes <32 are no longer converted to "_".
              If you leave "Organization" field in Personal Settings
              empty, it will be completely omitted from outgoing e-mails
              (no more "Organization: (null)" lines ;-).
              "NoProxy4all" and "NoFTPProxy4all" ARACHNE.CFG variables
              (substrings of host names for which proxy shouldn't be used,
              eg. ".myprovider.com") were finaly enabled.
              Bug in Tab/Shift+Tab navigation in frames was fixed.
              Security was improved - Arachne's extensions to <INPUT> tag
              (see AEXTHTML.TXT) are now allowed only in local documents.
              Arachne now generates PPPDRC.CFG file for EPPPD.EXE in format
              which allows spaces in usernames and passwords.
              Quality of truecolor bitmap (BMP, "Fast JPEGs") rendering
              in 256 color and 16 color modes (SVGA, VGA, EGA) was improved.
              Output fields (INPUT TYPE="OUTPUT"> are no longer editable.
              When HTML page contains "<OPTION>blah blah\n<OPTION>blah2..."
              bug, the end of line is no longer converted to extra space.
     Changes: Default target frame for mailto: HREFs is now always "_top".
              Font for <INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT"|"RESET"|"BUTTON"|"OUTPUT"> was
              changed to get more Netscape-like look'n'feel. System font
              (fixed width) is now used only for text input boxes.
              Some design changes, and quite radical changes in HTML rendering.
              EMBED tag was restricted to local files (will be reimplemented
              later).
              ASCII printing was made more usable - maximum number of
              characters on one line is now strictly accepted.
              Extra XSWAP optimization was enabled (see '?' hotkey).
              Internal editor is now able to load virtualy any HTML file,
              because long lines are wrapped at position of first space
              which is found over 2/3 of maximum line length, which is
              1024 characters. It means that HTML code of edited page
              should be always compatible, because in HTML, line break is
              treated the same way as standard space character.
              Small Hotlist manager modification.
Improvements: Arachne 1.60 beta is based on WATTCP release "9911" which
              should be faster, more stable, and it which supports DHCP.
              <TD VALIGN="TOP"|"MIDDLE" (or "CENTER")|"BOTTOM"> was
              implemented; default vertical alignment is now "MIDDLE".
              Better frame implementation - <FRAME SCROLLING="No"> and
              <FRAME BORDER="false" | FRAMEBORDER="0"> is now valid.
              Optimization of overlays (improves performance if Arachne
              is used without any disk caching).
              F3 key (URL input prompt) can be used even in fullscreen mode.
              When mail download or upload is invoked when user is offline,
              simple floppy-mail exchange is possible (small MIME.CFG patch).
              Form Feed (ASCII 12) character is appended to exported ASCII.
              Insight 3.5 sorts folders in alphabetical order and it remembers
              last used folder.
              Mail message can be displayed either in Desktop page style
              (often unreadable, because of background image) or as
              Default HTML page style (readable - usualt black on gray)
              ARACHNE.CFG variable is "MailIsDesktop Yes|No".
              New extension to <INPUT TYPE=TEXT> and <TEXATAREA> tags:
              <TEXTAREA ..ACTIVE> and <INPUT .. ACTIVE> will cause
              the atom to get keyboard focus when page is loaded (useful
              for mail composer, internal editor, Quick notepad...)
              Optional PrintScreen handler is capable of saving screenshot
              to BMP file. Works only in 256 colors and Hicolor modes.
              Arachne is also able to print page to BMP (Ctrl+P hotkey)
              and print-file dialogues were improved.
              New screensaver-related surprises were added ;-)
              Local file listings now use variable number of columns
              (up to 8 columns in 1024*768 - use Reload button to synchronize
              when you return back to 800x600 or 640x???)
              New hotkey '?' dumps XSWAP debug information to screen
              (ugly, but useful when complaining about speed, etc. - see
              file xswap.txt). This is related to better XSWAP crash
              diagnostics: please report full text of enhanced XSWAP
              crash message to me (xchaos@arachne.cz).
              Speed improvement: button animation is not complete - Arachne
              doesn't wait for user to release mouse to start operation,
              eg. submit HTML form.
              <INPUT TYPE="RESET"> was finaly implemented - the page is
              reloaded from disk, which resets all forms.
              Number of HTML tables Arachne can handle is no longer fixed,
              tables are now allocated dynamicaly and you can have as
              many tables as you can stack in XSWAP memory manager (up to
              several hundereds tables).
