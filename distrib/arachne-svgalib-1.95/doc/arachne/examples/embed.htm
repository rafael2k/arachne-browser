<EMBED SRC="welcome.wav">
<H1>Embeded sound file</H1>
This is example of sound file embeded in HTML page.
Any audio format defined in MIME.CFG can be embeded using
&lt;EMBED&gt; tag. While the sound is being played, user can't do
anything else. The situation is better for memory resident MIDI 
players, as calling the player will start the playback on background,
and then Arachne will restart. In this case, there is problem 
how to stop the music: solution can be defining program for unloading
MIDI player from memory as DGI script. Only recommended for experienced
Arachne and DOS users.
<P>
<I>Note 1: it's obvious, that this example will work only if 
you have correct plugin for playing WAV files on your audio device...
<P>
Note 2: this feature is currently available only for local web pages
(file: protocol).
