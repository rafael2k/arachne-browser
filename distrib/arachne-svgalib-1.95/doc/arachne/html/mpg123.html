<H1>Using mpg123 to play MP3 streams</H1>
<HR Size=4>
If your Linux kernel is properly configured to support sound
if you have mpg123 in search path (eg. /usr/bin/mpg123), Arachne
will instantly play any local .mp3, .pls or .m3u file - online
MP3 files (audio/mpeg) are considered to be rather file downloads.
But what's most important, Arachne will launch mpg123 also for
playing audio/x-mpegurl and audio/x-scpls, two major MIME types
used for linking MP3 streams from web, which are used by

or <A HREF="http://yp.icecast.org">Icecast</A>.

<P>
Cofiguring sound in Linux should be pretty easy with most 
standard SoundBlaster compatible cards, if you know your card's
IRQ and other parameters - check BLASTER enviroment variable in DOS
if you are not sure. For most cards and latest Linux distributions, 
running <B>sndconfig</B> should be sufficient, for older cards,
you may have to compile kernel; if you are using Gravis Ultrasound
like me, don't forget to select "Persistent DMA buffers" options
when configuring kernel.
