<H3>ACF - Arachne Configuration Files</H3>

ACF files are simply copies of ARACHNE.CFG file. Once you configure 
and fine-tune Arachne for some Internet provider, you can create two
copies of ARACHNE.CFG files, each containing different user name,
e-mail address, POP3 account, signature, mail directory, hotlist, etc.
Or you can use two profiles for two different providers, but both
with the same personal information. 
<P>
ACF files are maintained using special <A HREF="file://system/gui/profiles.ah">Profile manager</A>,
accessible for example from Desktop | Options page or from PPP dialer screen.

<H3>ASF - Arachne Script Files</H3>

ASF scripts are just lists of URLs to visit, nothing more. 
You can create scripts using any text editor...
For example:
<TABLE BORDER>
<CAPTION>MYSCRIPT.ASF</CAPTION>
<TD>
<PRE>
arachne:dialer
smtp:
pop3:
reload:http://home.arachne.cz/
reload:http://slashdot.org/
arachne:hangup
reload:file://inbox.dgi
file:d:\mp3\wakeup.mp3
file://inbox.dgi
</PRE>
</TABLE>

Special prefix "reload:" tells Arachne to always reload specified URL;
without this prefix, Arachne would use cached copy of object (if available).
Launching of MP3 file playback is of course only example: to do that, 
you have to install some plug-in capable of playing MP3 files (eg.
QuickView or XTC-player), and of course, the MP3 file included in the
script must exist.
<P>
To start ASF script, open it in Arachne: <A HREF="file://*.asf">*.asf</A>.
Typical Arachne screen from which you can launch scripts is 
<A HREF="arachne:dialpage">PPP dialer screen</A>.
<P>
Arachne currently doesn't offer any tool for creating ASF scripts (with
exception of "Request all links" and "Audio playlist" features - but
they doesn't produce user-editable scripts). 
You are expected to use some external ASCII text editor. If necessary, you 
can use <A HREF="file://system\gui\quickpad.ah">QuicKpad</A> to write 
script file and save it to file with .ASF extension using Ctrl+W hotkey.
