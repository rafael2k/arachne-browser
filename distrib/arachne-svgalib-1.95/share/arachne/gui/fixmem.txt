HTMLPIPE.COM REPLACES FIXMEM.EXE                                   01/03/14

The ASM language utility HTMLPIPE.com will function EXACTLY as FIXMEM.exe
was intended.  Simply rename it to FIXMEM.com.  It also does MORE !!

You will note that HTMLPIPE.com is more that *20* times smaller than
FIXMEM.exe and yet it does everything FIXMEM does *BETTER*.
Consider also that HTMLPIPE.com has only 145 bytes of executeable code
and the rest is ALL pre-formatted text for output. Since FIXMEM also
has the same text in it, the FIXMEM.EXE executable portion is actually
about *55* times bigger than HTMLPIPE.com !!

HTMLPIPE is BETTER because:
1) It does NOT produce a useless button on the screen in the "more" mode.
2) It filters HTML specific characters like "<>/\&" and converts them to
   entities.
3) It actually DOES work as an HTMLPIPE ! If a non "/" switchchar is found
   on the commandline, it assumes NON fixmem mode, and simply converts the
   input to pre-formatted html without any header.

Christof Lange of Prague told me that my first FIXMEM didn't handle the
hi ASCII characters the same as Michael's. I didn't think of it - I just
deleted them.

This is a newer version which instead replaces the chars above 7Fh with
spaces to maintain column formatting, as Michael's did.

Also this new version changes the Arachne line "Arachne requires 425kb"
to "Arachne requires 550kb..." to reflect the truth.
Arachne v1.70 won't even LOAD with 4*7*5 kb (needs another 5kb to load)
and 550kb is the minimum if you intend to go online.

*

Operation:
Copy or rename HTMLPIPE.com to FIXMEM.com.

Standard .DGI line:
file/mem.dgi         >HTM|mem|$esystem\\dgi\\fixmem>$2
                           Note: zero or one space ^ allowed here.
Result:
Just like FIXMEM.exe except the button is in a better place. <G>

Standard .DGI line:
file/memc.dgi        >HTM|mem /c|$esystem\\dgi\\fixmem /c>$2
      Note: Only one space plus the "/" is recognized ^^ the rest is dummy.

Result:
Just like FIXMEM.exe except there is NO button.

Take a look at the MEM.dgi lines that *I* use. Better if you use QEMM.
file/mem.dgi         >HTM|mem /C|$esystem\\dgi\\fixmem>$2
file/memc.dgi        >HTM|LOADHI|$esystem\\dgi\\fixmem /c>$2
That second one doesn't actually load anything high - it uses the loadhi
program to display upper memory usage by region.

*

NON Standard .DGI line: *EXAMPLE ONLY*
file/dir.dgi         >HTM|DIR c:\|$esystem\\dgi\\fixmem dir>$2
Note: One space + ANY non "/" switches it to PIPE mode. ^

Result ?
Use the included dirdgi.htm (mostly courtesy Glenn McCorkle) to try it.;-)

Here's another use:
file/.zip            >HTM|[75]PKUNZIP -v $1|$esystem\\dgi\\fixmem dir>$2

Have FUN ! 8-)
