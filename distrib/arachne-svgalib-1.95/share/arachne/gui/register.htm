How to register Arachne</h1>

<hr SIZE=6>
<ul>
<li>
Arachne is distributed as a FREE software package that contains a SHAREWARE
evaluation version of the browser itself and various FREEWARE or PUBLIC
DOMAIN utilities. Nobody should charge more for redistribution of the package
than the cost of the media and copying expenses.</li>

<li>
Without registering, you can use the copyrighted parts of Arachne only
for personal or <a href="file://nonprofi.htm">NON-COMMERCIAL purposes</a>.
If you want to use Arachne for other purposes, for example distribute it
as a part of your product, you MUST register. Some of the features of the
registered version are not available without the registration key. Currently
these features are:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Full customization of the eMail signature</li>

<li>
Online time counter (files <a href="file://online.log">online.log</a> and
<a href="file://ppptotal.log">ppptotal.log</a>)</li>

<li>
The ability to disable annoying banners (images of size 468x60 pixels)</li>

<li>
Various OEM customizations</li>

<li>
Toolkit for customization of the Arachne user interface.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Unless you register, we will not provide you any technical support, but
we try to analyse and solve problems REGISTERED users experience with Arachne.</li>

<li>
You can register the Arachne WWW browser by buying a REGISTRATION KEY from
xChaos software or from any authorised distributor. Licensing for OEM devices
must be discussed individually with the author (contact <a href="mailto:sales@arachne.cz">sales@arachne.cz</a>)</li>
