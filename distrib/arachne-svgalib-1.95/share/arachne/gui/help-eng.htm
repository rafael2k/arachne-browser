<H1>ARACHNE HELP PAGE: Internet and E-mail</H1>
by Bastiaan Edelman<BR>

<H3>You can do both with a single dial-up telephone call !<BR>
<BR>Exit Arachne with <I>Alt+X</I><BR>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON>Did you use the wizards to properly set up ARACHNE?<BR>
If not, please do so by pressing the <I><U>O</U></I> key for <I><U>O</U></I>ptions</FONT></H3>
<HR>
<H1><FONT COLOR=RED>Internet:</H1></FONT><HR>

<B>Before you can surf the World Wide Web, you first have to dial up your
Internet Service Provider (ISP).<BR>
Type <I>Alt+D</I> [Dial] to establish the connection.<BR>
You will then be connected to the "HomePage" (default = http://arachne.cz)<BR>
Do you want to visit a different URL? Use the <I>F3</I> key and type the new URL in the <I>URL box</I>
and press <I>ENTER</I>.<BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=GREEN>Do you want to disconnect from the Web? Use the
<I>Alt+H</I>[Hang up] key to disconnect the phone.</FONT><P></B>
* Not all internet sites can be viewed with Arachne. Sites using "java script",
"flash" or secure connections (https), e.g., to your bank, will function only in part or not at all.<BR>
* You can alter the starting "HomePage" in the arachne.cfg configuration file.
<HR><B>

<FONT COLOR=RED><H1>E-mail:</H1>
<H3>Press the <I><U>M</U></I> key for <I><U>M</u>ail</i></H3></FONT><HR>
Now you are on the <I>Mail Page</I>. The icons you see are
activated by a mouse click for the 'service' you want to use.<BR>
Click the icon and not the caption. Several icons have a caption with a character
underlined, called the <I>Hot Key</I>. E.g., the hot key for the <U>I</U>nbox is <I><U>I</U></I>.<HR>

<H3><Font COLOR=RED>Get new mail</FONT></H3>
Click this icon to collect your mail from your ISP.
If you are not already connected to your ISP, Arachne gives you an Error page
with an option to key <I>Alt+D</I> to dial, connect, and thus access your
provider's e-mail service.<BR>
If there is any mail, Arachne will download it and place it in the INBOX
where you can view it, either immediately or after disconnecting.<P>
If you have mail in the OUTBOX that is ready to send, do it now while the telephone line is
still open. Click on the "Send Unsent Mail" icon.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=GREEN>To keep telephone costs low, hang up the phone NOW => <I>Alt+H</I>.<BR></FONT>

Surfing the Web, sending outgoing mail, and downloading incoming mail
.... all are possible with just one phone call.<HR>


<H3><FONT COLOR=RED><u>I</U>NBOX</I></FONT></H3>
The INBOX contains the incoming mail.<BR> Do you want to read a message?
Click on the green text of the subject line to open the message, including
attachments.<BR>

<FONT COLOR=GREEN>
Although it is safe to open attachments in Arachne, it is a good custom to delete
any e-mail, including all attachments, if you are uncertain where the e-mail
came from or in any other way do not trust the mail. (About deleting:
read on.)<BR>
A virus is a (small) program that is meant to <I>DO</I> some (nasty)
things. Arachne does not allow programs coming from outside Arachne (internet, e-mail)
to execute, i.e., <I>DO</I> anything. Pretty good protection, isn't it?<BR>
Most viruses are aimed at the Windows operating system and can <U>not</U>run under DOS,
another good protection.<BR></FONT>
<HR>
<BR><FONT COLOR=MAROON>Arachne can handle these types of files:<BR>
<LI>.TXT = text file
<LI>.HTM = HTML text
<P>
<LI>.JPG = image
<LI>.GIF = image
<LI>.BMP = image
<P></FONT></B>
<LI>.DOC = an MS-Word text file. <BR>* However, since MS-Word runs under
Windows, we have to use a support program like VIEW.EXE. The "Word" file will
then be converted to plain text and the images included in a "Word" file
will not be shown.<BR>
<P><B>

Files that cannot be handled by Arachne can, like <U>all</U>files, be
saved to any directory on the hard drive of the computer, a diskette, or even
to a CD and then handled by appropriate programs.<BR>
Example: you received an e-mail with a .pdf file attached.<BR> Save the .pdf
file to disk or (if you are running in an MS-DOS window) to a Windows directory
where it can subsequently be viewed, e.g., with Acrobat Reader in Windows.</B><BR>
* It is possible to view .pdf files with DOS and Arachne, but this is a
complicated matter for advanced users only.
<P><B>

<Font color=maroon><H3>Save with <I>F2</I> key</H3></FONT>
The default subdirectory for saving your files is .\download. You may
change the destination directory and the filename to what you like, but
do <U>not</U> change the extension.<BR><FONT color="MAROON">
DOS does not allow long file names; up to 8 characters may be used before
the extension. A valid file name in DOS is: 12345678.ext or abcdefgh.txt.<BR>
<BR></FONT>

Example: You have an e-mail in your inbox with the subject "Holland Promotion".
Opening this e-mail by clicking on the green text in the subject line will
show the message, the name of the message, and all attachments sent with
this message.<BR> The message is stored in the Arachne .\mail subdirectory
and has been named by Arachne to something like: 01414700.cnm. All incoming
mail receives a .cnm extension.<BR>
This raw version of the message, as received from your ISP, can be renamed
and saved into any directory in your system. Let's save it...<BR>
Open the message and press the <I>F2</I> key.  If you want the e-mail message
renamed to new-name.cnm and then saved to .\download\new-name.cnm, change the
default "Save to: .\download\01414700.cnm" to your preference.
<BR>The e-mail has an attachment called nl.pdf. If you click on the attachment
the next screen states: "Arachne does not know how to handle this file" and
offers to save it as .\download\nl.pdf. However, you would like to save
nl.pdf to a diskette with the new name holland.pdf.
<P>
#1 Insert a diskette into the A: drive<BR>
#2 Change the proposed filename from .\download\nl.pdf to A:\holland.pdf<BR>
#3 Press the <I>ENTER</I>key<BR>
<P>
Attachment #2, holland.jpg<BR>
Arachne displays .jpg, .gif and .bmp images. These images are shown on your
monitor. Since the image attachments are already opened by Arachne they cannot
be saved with a simple click on the attachment name.<BR>
Place the cursor on the image and mark the image with the <I>Shift+Enter</I>
keys. Next use the <I>F2</I>key to choose the destination and name to
save this image.
<P>
</B>More generally, you can save any image shown on the monitor by placing
the cursor over that image on the screen, pressing <I>Shift+Enter</I> (you
will see the image again, but now isolated from text or other images), and
saving it using the <I>F2 </I>key.<B>
<P>

<H3><FONT COLOR=MAROON>Use hot key <I><U>P</U></I> [printer]</H3></FONT><p>
With the <i><U>P</U>rinter</i> command in Arachne you can print your files, but <u>TEXT</U>
files <U>only</U>!<BR> You have a choice of actually printing to paper or to
"export" it to a file ; choose export and give the file name and
destination.<BR>
</B>
* You have to use a DOS-printer. "Win" printers will NOT function. A "Post
Script" printer is best, it will also print images.<BR><B>



<FONT COLOR=MAROON>
<HR>
<H3>Upper left-hand corner:<BR>
Move... | Trash » | Forward... | Reply |</H3></FONT>
These buttons are useful for determining the final disposition of your e-mail.<HR>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON><H3>| Move... |</H3></FONT>
Moves the e-mail to one of the dedicated "mail folders". Mail folders can
be made, filled and deleted... play with this toy and enjoy.

<P>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON><H3>| Trash » |</H3></FONT>
This button moves your unwanted mail to the waste bin. Files can be recovered
out of the trash bin. Use hotkey <U>M</u> [Mail] and click on the "Trash" icon to
access the message, or click on the "Empty Trash" icon to delete it permanently.<P>

<FONT COLOR=MAROON> Delete</FONT><BR>
You can also delete your mail from the <I><U>I</U>nbox</I> directly. Click on
the green subject line NOT with the left mouse button (to read the mail) but
with the right button - the mail is now colored yellow. Press the <i>DELETE</I>
key and the message is gone; no recovery possible.<BR>
You may mark several messages yellow and delete them all at once with the
<I>DELETE</I> key.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON><H3>| Forward... |</H3></FONT>
Forward a message to someone. Pay attention to the address!<BR>
You can add comments and attachments to the message to forward. Save the
message to the <I>OUTBOX</i> with the 'Save to OUTBOX [F2]' button.

<P>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON><H3>| Reply... |</H3></FONT>
A reply to a message is not difficult. A click on the <I>REPLY</I> button will do.<BR>
But first you have to decide if you want your reply to go to the "From" or
"Reply to" address, and if you want to include the original message or to start
with a blank screen. The choice is yours.<BR>
After you have made your choices, click on <I>Reply</I> and the color of the
message text will turn to green on a black background, i.e., if you are in the
internal editing mode and not using an external editor.<BR>
Type your new text or your comments to the message you are replying to.<BR>
Attachments must be attached now in the attachment boxes.
<P>
Text from a .txt file may also be included. <BR>Place the cursor where you want
the extra text inserted.<BR> Type <I>CTRL+R</I> [Read] and give the file name
and the full path to where it is located.
<P>
EXAMPLE:<BR>
You want to insert the text file example.txt from a diskette.<BR>
CTRL+R [read text file]<BR>
Type: A:\example.txt<BR>
ENTER
<P>
After the completion of your reply mail: press the 'Save to OUTBOX [F2]' button.
<P>
<HR>
<FONT COLOR=RED><H3>Mail folders</H3></FONT>
Clicking the "mail folders" icon will show you the existing mail folders.
Click on one of them, and you are able to view, edit, forward or delete the
e-mails saved in the mail folder the same as in the <I>INBOX</I>.

<HR>
<FONT COLOR=RED><H3>Sent Mail</H3></FONT>
Mail already <I>Sent</I> is stored in the .\MAIL subdirectory.<P>
Extensions:<BR>
...cnm = <U>see n</U>ew <U>m</U>ail in inbox<BR>
...tbs = <U>t</U>o <U>b</U>e <U>s</U>end mail in outbox<BR>
...snt = <U>s</U>e<U>nt</U> mail<P>
With the <I>Sent Mail</I> icon you can open, edit, delete and resend already
sent mail.
<HR>

<FONT COLOR=RED><H3><U>C</U>ompose mail</H3></FONT>
The hot key <U><I>C</U></I> [COMPOSE] invokes the internal editor. You may
have met this editor already by using the F4 key or in replying to an e-mail.
<p>
<Font color=green>Sometimes the 'word wrap' feature does not seem to wrap.
Check if there is a space at the end of the line. If so, press the <i>END</I>
key and remove that space. 'Word wrap' should now work properly.<P></FONT>



<P>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON>Inserting a (text) file into your message.</FONT><BR>
You are a scout and you have written a piece of text residing on your HD under
C:\scouts\hobby.txt. Do you want to type it all over again?<BR>
Of course not! Place the cursor on the spot where you want 'hobby.txt'
to appear.<BR>
Press <I>CTRL+R</I><BR>
Type: C:\scouts\hobby.txt and press <I>ENTER</I>.<BR>
<P>

<P><FONT COLOR=MAROON>Attachments</FONT><BR>
Only .txt files can be inserted into your message by <I>CTRL+R</I>. All
other files, images, zip, word, pdf, etc. must be attached to your e-mail.
However up to 4 attachments are allowed.<BR>
Place the cursor in the first attachment box and give the file name and the
full path (if files from outside the Arachne directory are to be attached).
<BR>
<P><HR>

<FONT COLOR=RED><H3>Send Files</H3></FONT>
If you have more than 4 attachments to send, use the
<I>Send files</I> icon on the <i><U>M</U>ail</I> page.
<P>
<HR>

<FONT COLOR=RED><H3>OUTBOX</H3></FONT>
All files ready for uploading to your ISP are located here. You can
view them and if you are not happy, you may <I>Modify</I> them.<BR>
<FONT COLOR=GREEN>When modifying your mail, all
attachments are lost and must be attached again.</FONT>

<P><HR>
<FONT COLOR=RED><H3>Send unsent mail</H3></FONT>
Click on the icon to send your unsent mail. If you are not already connected
to your ISP, you will get an Error screen with an option to dial <I>Alt+D</I>.<BR>
<BR>Are all messages sent? Check by clicking on the "Sent Messages" icon. <BR>
<BR>Press the <U>M</U> hotkey and <I>Get New Mail</I> to check if there is any
new mail.
After downloading this, <font color=green>use <I>Alt+H</I> to hang up the
phone!</FONT>
<P><HR>

<FONT COLOR=RED><H3>Address book ...... Make mailing list</H3></FONT>
Many viruses use an 'address book' to copy themselves to all your
friends. Although Arachne can't be used by a virus to copy the address book
the best protection is not to use it at all...<P>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON><H3>Use e-dress list</H3></FONT>
All e-mail addresses are stored in the file 'e-dress.txt' with each entry on a
separate line like this:

<FONT COLOR=GREEN><PRE>
"Bastiaan" &#60;bastiaan.pa3ffz@hetnet.nl&#62;
"Redactie CQ-PA" &#60;cqpa@vrza.org&#62;
"Zwarte Piet" &#60;pieterman@sinterklaas.sp&#62;</PRE></FONT>
<P>
The e-dress list can be found in the main Arachne directory: as "e-dress.txt" or
at the bottom of the <I><U>I</U>nbox/Reply</I> page or at the
<I><U>C</U>ompose</I> new mail pages. Help for e-dress is present there too.<BR>
You might also use <I>F3</I> and make the URL:<FONT COLOR=GREEN> file:e-dress.txt
</FONT>. Changes to the list can be made with hot key <i>F4</I> [edit file].
<P>
<FONT COLOR=GREEN>
<H3>!TIP!</H3>
Suppose you want to send all the members of your family an e-mail.<BR>
Make a mailing list, or copy the addresses to a new list, just like the
e-dress list format.<BR>
Call this list 'family' (no extension) and save the family list to the
Arachne main directory.<BR>
Type in the "To:" field of your e-mail "@family" and Arachne will send
your message to all addresses on your "family" list.<BR>
The addressees cannot detect the names of the other addressees on the list;
just "@family" is shown.<BR>
Type your own address as the last entry on that list, to check out if this
really functions.<BR></FONT>
<HR>

<FONT COLOR=RED><H3>Trash and Empty trash</H3></FONT>
Use "Trash" to recover and "Empty Trash" for final deletion of e-mails.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=RED><H3>More help...</H3></FONT>
More help will be translated... but this is all for now.<BR>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON>Use your Arachne and play with it...</FONT>
<P>
