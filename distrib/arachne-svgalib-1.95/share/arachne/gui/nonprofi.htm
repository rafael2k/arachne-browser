<H1><FONT 3D>Registration for NON-profit organizations</FONT></H1>
<HR SIZE=6>

xChaos software has already tried many ways to make Arachne easily 
available to schools, hospitals, and non-profit organizations in general.
We believe that the importance of the Internet can be compared to the importance
of Gutenberg's invention of book printing, and that the Internet should be 
accessible to everyone. Especially schools and hospitals in the  
not-so-rich parts of the world can't afford to upgrade their PCs every 
year, so they may appreciate that the World Wide Web will now be accessible 
from their Local Area Networks. 
<P>
Arachne can be legally used for <I>non-commercial use</I> as it is distributed - 
with no registration key. If you want a registration key, you have to
buy it - because generation of keys for non-profit organizations
can't be done automaticaly, and we have to spend our time and 
workforce reading the sales mailbox, paying telecommunication bills, etc.
<P>
The price of an Arachne non-commercial registration is:

<H1>30 USD for every 100 installations of Arachne</H1>

This is because transferring less then 30 USD is quite inefficient
and only banks would profit from it. However, the cost of 30 US cents per 
single installation should be acceptable for almost any organization
which can afford to own a PC and pay telecomunication bills. 

<P>
<I>This doesn't mean that non-profit organizations MUST pay
for Arachne - it only means, that we won't send them free registration
keys any longer</I>.
