This is preliminary version of extended codepage conversion tables
for Arachne. To enable viewing of HTML documents encoded in different
codepage than one corresponding to Arachne fonts (and different than
those for which suitable *.CP files are included in Arachne font APMs),
please do the following:

(1) If you are using default Western Arachne fonts (ISO88591.APM),
    please copy all files from ISO88591 directory in this archive to
    SYSTEM\CODEPAGE subdirectory in your Arachne directory (typically,
    C:\ARACHNE).

(2) If you are using East European fonts (i.e., have installed
    ISO88592.APM), please copy the files from ISO88592 directory
    instead.

(3) If you are using Cyrillic fonts in Windows encoding (i.e., have
    installed 1251.APM), please copy the files from 1251 directory.

(4) If you are using Cyrillic fonts in KOI8-R encoding (i.e., have
    installed KOI8-R.APM), please copy the files from KOI8-R directory.

Note: Currently only Latin and Cyrillic (partially) alphabets are
supported. Conversion from Cyrillic to Latin is done by simple
transliteration, very similar to KOI8-R 8-bit -> 7-bit conversion,
except that there is no upper/lowercase flip. Some Cyrillic letters
must be mapped into special characters. This simple mapping is imposed
by limitations of current Arachne core (only one set of 256 characters
displayed at a time, and only 1 character to 1 character conversion).

To do (volunteers needed):

(1) Integration into existing APMs.

(2) More alphabets and codepages.

(3) Corrections.
