                           comtool
                           -------
This is a new version of my comtool program. This version has 
hardwarehandshake built in. The local buffer is increased
to 1kB now. This fixed the problems with lost characters
when using 57600bps or 115.200bps under windows. I added a
new command wich allows you to enable/disable the fifo if
you have a serial port with a 16550 uart (^Fn)

I wrote 'comtool' because I needed a small program for testing and
commanding my serial ports and my modem. I use it for example to clear
the uart, set the baudrate and the control-lines of my modem or send some
'AT'- command sequences with it. You can even use it as a simple terminal
programm. (hint: install an ANSI-driver, nnansi is a good one).

You may invoke comtool either by defining portadress and hardware interrupt
or by writing only the number of comport (using a 'standard'-port)

comtool <Port-address> <irq> <Commands> or
comtool <number_of_ComPort> <Commands>

Each command begins with a 'caret' like this one ^. If there is no caret,
the following text will be send 'as is'.

Some Commands:
^fn    Enable/disable Fifo (if you have a 16550 uart). The hexadecimal
       value n is written to the FCR (baseaddress + 2). 
       n=0   disable fifo
       n=1   enable fifo, triggerlevel is 1
       n=41               triggerlevel is 4
       n=81               triggerlevel is 8
       n=c1               triggerlevel is 14
^tn    wait n/10 seconds
^cr    send cr-character
^lf    send lf-character
^sp    send space-character
^^     send 'caret'
^d1    set dtr on
^d0    set dtr off
^h     hangup
^bn    set baudrate, n=0 115200
                     n=1 57600
                     n=2 38400
                     n=3 19200
                     n=4 9600
                     n=5 4800
                     n=6 2400 
                     n=7 1200
^kn    send break-character, duration is n/10 seconds
^CDn   wait n/10 seconds for carrier-detect-signal. Set errorlevel 8 if
       time over or user breaked, otherwise set errorlevel to 4
^wn string1 string2 string3
       wait n/10 seconds for string1 (or 2 or 3), set the errorlevel
       to 1, 2 or 3 if found or 8 if user breaked or time was over
^0n    send character with asci-value n. n is a hexadecimal expression < 256
       
Special keys:
Alt-H  Hangup the modem (may not work on all modems)
Alt-E  Exit comtool (may not work with all keyboards)
Ctrl-Break (or Ctrl-C) Breaks comtool (if Alt-E does'nt work)

new in comtool:
Alt-S Stops/Resumes transfer of data. The RTS handshakesignal is toggled.
       (The modem must be programmed for hardwarehandshake of course)

Don't use the '<' - characters on commandline, because this is
used for redirection. That means: you can create a comandfile with
one or more comandlines in it and redirect this to comlog with '< cmdfile'
on the commandline.

If the last charcter on the commandline is NOT a caret, then you are in the
terminal-mode. You can type AT-sequences, connect to a site with 'atdt ...'
or do whatever you want. You leave this mode with Alt-E and if this doesn't
work (a keyboard-problem, one day I'll fix it ;-), then try Ctrl-C or
Ctrl-Break. If the last Character was a caret, then the programm returns to
DOS automatically. You can recall this programm whenever you want:
All Interrupts and the uart-state are restored carefully. You may shellout
from an other communication-application, start comlog, do something with it
and return to your application without any effect on your application.
It work's even with windows ...

Errorlevel
----------
The bit relevant errorlevel delivered by 'COMTOOL', means:

8          comtool breaked (ctrl-c, alt-e...)
4          carrier detected by the ^CD- command
1,2 or 3   one of three strings in datastream detected (^W -command)

example for an autodial batch (comport 1 used):

@echo off
:rep
COMTOOL 1 ^B2 +++ ^T6 atZ ^CR atdp072441792 ^CR ^W600 CONNECT BUSY NO^
if errorlevel 8 goto ende
if errorlevel 3 goto ende
if errorlevel 2 goto rep
if errorlevel 1 goto termi
goto rep
:termi
COMTOOL 1
:ende
COMTOOL ^H ^
