If you are (or want to be) a new Internet user, and Arachne is your first
encounter with the technical terms describing Internet protocols and
applications and their configuration, configuring Arachne will not be an
easy task for you. This page contains short explanations of the most
frequently used words in the Arachne documentation.

<HR>
<A NAME="internet">
<H3>The Internet</H3>

The Internet is a worldwide network of computers based on the TCP/IP protcol. It
allows you to use many different services based on various Internet
protocols. The Internet is also known as the "Information highway".

<P>The most popular services are WWW and eMail, based on protcols
called HTTP, SMTP and POP3. Other well known services include FTP, Usenet
(news - protocol NNTP), Telnet and IRC. If you don't understand
what words like "service" or "protocol" mean, just picture all this
stuff as alternatives or enhancments to well known electronic
communication services like televison, voice phone or fax.

<P>There are also other
experimental services, like Internet Phone, See-You-See-Me, PointCast
network, ICQ or Internet Radio, which are not generaly understood as Internet
standards. Some of the Internet protocols, like Gopher or Finger are remnants
from an earlier chapter in the history of the Internet. It is very interesting 
and if you are interested in it, try to get a book about the Internet.

<HR>
<A NAME="tcpip">
<H3>TCP/IP</H3>

A family of communication protocols used on the Internet. Something like
the engine in a car: users don't have to know how it works, they only
have to know which kind of fuel they need, and where to go if something
goes wrong.
<P>
Most important among TCP/IP protocols
are TCP (transmission control protocol), IP (internet protocol) and UDP
(user datagram protocol). Pieces of data transported by TCP/IP are called packets.
<P>
Advanced operating systems (like Unix) implement TCP/IP as a basic system
service (on the same level as other I/O operations); in small systems like
DOS, TCP/IP must be integrated into the application. This is why configuring
Arachne is so confusing: you are configuring both TCP/IP and the browser (and
if you are using a modem, then a PPP dialer also) all in one program!
With Arachne, you are provided with a complete network solution, which 
together with the operating system fits onto one floppy and can be booted from it.
<P>
TCP/IP was designed for permanently connected computers; if you want to
connect using a phone line and modem, you will need to establish a SLIP or PPP
protocol between your Internet provider and your computer to transfer
TCP/IP packets to your computer.

<HR>
<A NAME="www">
<H3>WWW</H3>

WWW stands for World Wide Web. It is a system of online hypertext pages, located
on many servers all around world. Pages are written in the HTML language
and linked to each other. Pages can also contain links to objects
of different types, like soundtracks, movies, live audio and video
broadcasting, etc.
<P>
Arachne is a WWW client - a program which can
request, download and view HTML pages. The WWW uses a protocol called HTTP.
<P>
The only mass communication technology that is as easy to use as the WWW
is probably television. Users of the World Wide Web are expected only to
be able to read and to know how to use a mouse to select hypertext
links, nothing more.

<HR>
<A NAME="email">
<H3>eMail</H3>

eMail, E-mail, or email are various shortened versions of "electronic mail".
<P>
Electronic mail is simply an exchange of text messages (which can contain
attached encoded files) between Internet users. Arachne can currently
send and receive simple eMail messages, using protocols called SMTP (sending
eMails) and POP3 (downloading eMail from mailbox). Every user
of Internet mail is assigned a unique address of format
<B>username@domain</B>. Your username does not have to be identical
to your login name. The domain is usually (but not always) the name
of your provider's mail server.
<P>
Having a personal eMail address is probably as common today as having
a personal telephone number.

<HR>
<A NAME="ppp">
<H3>PPP</H3>

Point to Point Protocol. A protocol which transfers TCP/IP packets through
your modem and connects your computer to the Internet. There are three
ways to authenticate a PPP connection: the first option is to ask for manual
login (like if you are calling a BBS system) whereafter the PPP protocol
starts without further verification (you will see a bunch of characters like
 ~,#,!, etc. in the terminal window). Arachne can do an automatic login
to an internet service provider, if you configure it correctly.
The second option is called Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)
and the third one is Challenge Authentication Protocol (CHAP).
The PPP dialer shipped with Arachne currently supports PAP, but CHAP is already
supported by the latest release of DOSPPPD.

<HR>
<A NAME="url">
<H3>URL</H3>

Universal Resource Locator. You have probably seen announcments like
"Visit internet homepage of Some Company at
<B>http://www.somecompany.com/</B>. This is a typical URL.
It is an identifier for resources that are accessible by WWW browser, most often
an HTML page accessible using the HTTP protocol. In Arachne, you must
first connect to the Internet. Once you are connected, just press the F3 key,
enter the URL you want and press Enter.
<P>
The URL syntax is
<B>protocol://[username[:password]@]hostname[:port][/URI]</B>
<P> URI
is a shortcut for Uniform Resource Identifier, and it is in fact very
often just a filename of a document or program located on the WWW server.

<HR>
<A NAME="opendos">
<H3>OpenDOS</H3>

We described Arachne as a "DOS application". This means that in principle, 
Arachne can run under various types of operating systems that are compatible 
with MS-DOS 3.3: MS-DOS up to 6.22, Windows 95, OS/2, DR-DOS, NovellDOS, DOSEMU under Linux,
SoftPC under NextStep (all these options were tested). However, we recommend
that you use Caldera OpenDOS, a clone of DOS, which is free for non-commercial
use. Even inexperienced users can easily configure OpenDOS using its built-in 
setup utility. And you can easily download latest patches and upgrades of OpenDOS
from the Caldera Website.
<P>
OpenDOS is the latest member of Digital Research's CP/M development line: 
CP/M ... DR-DOS ... Novell DOS ... Caldera (DR)OpenDOS.

<HR>
<A NAME="mem">
<H3>DOS memory</H3>


When you are using MS-DOS, your computer with an Intel compatible processor
starts in "real mode": this means that even if you have a Pentium,
your computer generally behaves like a PC XT when you boot DOS, i.e.,
only 1 MB of RAM can be used directly by your programs, and the largest
executable program size can be up to 640 kB (but is usually less, since  
various device drivers must also be present in memory). More memory than
1 MB can be accessed only as storage space for data. It is called XMS or EMS 
memory.
<P>
But you are likely to have a 386 or better processor which can be switched to
"protected mode" (also called "32bit" mode) to access all the memory. From
DOS, you can do this, for example, by using a DPMI driver. You are probably
asking why Arachne is a real mode application, running only in the first 640
kB of your PC's memory. The reason is that the golden era of DOS ocurred on 
real mode computers, and most development tools, libraries, and helper applications
feel best in real or "V8086" (also called "Virtual") mode.
Developing applications for protected mode DOS is a much more complex task.

<P>
Arachne, as a real mode application, is a very small program and fits onto a
single floppy: compare this to protected mode applications, written in object-oriented
languages. They are ten times larger and take forever to download from
the Internet. Arachne was developed mainly for PCs with a 80286-,
80386-, or 80486-compatible CPU and with only several MB of RAM, where
real mode DOS applications perform much better than Windows applications.
On Pentium P5/P6 (trademark of Intel), AMD K5/K6 or various 80586 and 80686
machines with more than 8 MB of memory, real mode applications
are not able to use the full potential of the system. However, you can
use an extended memory manager like EMM386 or QEMM to optimize a "virtual
DOS machine" on your 386 or better computer. This is very efficient and
actually much faster than the operating systems which are expected to run on
these machines. Using DOS on Pentium class computers probably can give you
more "real-time" feel then using any other OS.

<HR>
<A NAME="ramdisk">
<H3>RAM disk</H3>

DOS is able to use the extra memory of your system as a virtual file system,
called a RAM disk. If your PC has more than 8 MB of memory, you should
definitely think about configuring such a RAM disk to increase the speed of your
DOS applications, including Arachne. This will probably give you the fastest
operating system ever available: while 32bit operating systems use your
hard disk as virtual memory, with 16bit DOS you can use your memory as a very
fast hard disk. This can increase, for example, the speed of JPEG decompression
in Arachne, etc. The problem is that the content of a RAM disk is lost when
you turn off your computer. Configuring Arachne to run from a RAM disk (by
copying its home directory to the RAM disk) but using directories for mail 
and downloaded files on the hard disk can be a good solution.
<P>
Check your system manual or configuration utility for information on how
to configure a RAM disk on your PC.

<HR>
<I>This list will be more extensive in future releases of Arachne</I>
