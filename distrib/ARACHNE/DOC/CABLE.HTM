<H1>Arachne and Cable Modem</H1>
<HR SIZE=4>
The following lines were kindly provided by L.D.Best, a long time Arachne user.
Basically, this document says that using Arachne with a cable modem is 
identical to using it on any <a href="lan.htm">Ethernet based LAN</a>,
but this doesn't mean the document is not worth reading.
<hr>
<h3>How Is A Cable Modem Different?</h3>
A cable modem is unique, in that it uses a combination of an ethernet
card to allow your computer to communicate with the modem, while the
cable modem accesses something similar to a WAN [Wide Area Network] to
communicate via cable with the ISP. &nbsp; You have some control over
the ethernet card via the driver you install, but all you'll need to
do with the cable modem is hook it up, plug in the DC adapter, and
turn it on.<p>

<h3>I have a Cable Modem on my system. &nbsp;How do I install Arachne?</h3>
To install Arachne on a system with cable modem in place, follow the
instructions for installation of Arachne, and select "Ethernet."
&nbsp; Allow the installation to search for the NIC and there should
be no problems getting Arachne running.<p>

<h3>I use Arachne now. &nbsp; I'm being offerred Cable Modem access. &nbsp; What do I need?</h3>
First, you will need to have a 10T ethernet NIC [Network Interface
Card] already installed, or have a free EISA or PCI slot available on
your system mainboard.<p>

Normally a communication package will be offerred with the service.
&nbsp; This should include 
<OL><LI>cable modem 
<LI> cable which goes between modem and NIC
<LI> NIC.
</UL>

Do not expect any cable tech to be able to install the ethernet card
on a DOS-only computer. &nbsp; But don't worry, it should be little
problem to install if they use a decent brand of NIC. <p>

If the package comes with a brand of NIC which does not include DOS
installation, or if no NIC at all is included, then you need to
obtain one. &nbsp; 3COM has both EISA and PCI 10T NICs. &nbsp; 3COM has DOS
drivers, and the CD which comes with their hardware includes drivers
and DOS installation. &nbsp; <p>

<i><b>BEFORE YOU START:</b> &nbsp; If you are going to use a 3COM NIC
[and possibly other brands, also] you <b>must</b> be using MS-DOS
EMM386.EXE from MS-DOS version 6.2 or higher. &nbsp; If you are using
an older version of DOS, you can utilize SETVER and replace your
EMM386 with the newer version. &nbsp; I'm sorry, but 3COM does not
recognize QEMM386.</i><p>

<h3>I have everything I need. &nbsp; Now what?</h3>
The instructions which come with the NIC should be simple and clear.
&nbsp; It's a matter of plugging in the card, and running the
'Install' program provided with it. &nbsp; This can include the option
of automatically adding the correct driver to AUTOEXEC.BAT.  &nbsp;
[Later you may want to set up autoexec by hand, or place the driver in
the batch file you use for Arachne.] &nbsp; Part of the installation
should include switches for that driver according to instructions
given.  &nbsp; One switch should be to indicate memory location for
the driver. &nbsp; <i>Note -- &nbsp;If you use 0x60 that would place
the driver in the same memory location as is used by Arachne for
dial-up, and you'll know it's right.</i><p>

<i>If you wish to learn more about network adapters, please read the Help
section</i> "<b>How to use Arachne on LAN</b>." <p>

<h3>Do I have to install Arachne again from scratch?</h3>
No -- it's much easier than that!

<LI> Copy your working
ARACHNE.CFG file to DIALUP.ACF
<LI> Load
ARACHNE.CFG into an editor and make the following changes:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Profile CABLE.ACF<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Connection READY<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delete everything between Hangup NUL and [tcp/ip]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under [tcp/ip] -- IP_Address BOOTP<br>
<I>Note: When you connect, Arachne will receive
and use all necessary NameServer, AltNameServer, Gateway, AltGateway,
and Netmask information dynamically.  You don't need to change
anything else under [tcp/ip]. &nbsp; Save your new Arachne.cfg and
make a copy called CABLE.ACF, and you're ready to go.</I>
