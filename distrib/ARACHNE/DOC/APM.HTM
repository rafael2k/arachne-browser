<H1>Arachne Package Manager</H1>
<HR SIZE=4>
The Arachne Package Manager is a very powerful and easy to use tool for upgrading Arachne.
It was designed to prevent the basic Arachne distribution package from growing too large and
to allow developers to make installation of plug-ins and DGI components
(generally patching Arachne) as easy as possible. Upgrading was never
easier than with APMs ! If you are a programmer, check the <A HREF="file://apm.txt">technical
documentation</A> to learn more.
<P>
Using Arachne Packages is very simple. You can download them from the
<A HREF="http://home.arachne.cz/download/">Arachne Download
Page</A> (but only if you are online). Just click on the package name to install it!
Arachne configuration files (MIME.CFG, WWWMAN.CFG, ARACHNE.CFG...)
will be updated automagically. You don't have to worry about
which APMs you need: when you encounter a new type of URL or
document, Arachne will automatically offer to download the appropriate
APM package. This allows automatic upgrading of even WebTV-style units,
etc.
<P>
Once you have downloaded any Arachne Packages from the net, you can store them in a special
directory as files with an <A HREF="file://*.apm">.APM</A> extension. After installing and configuring a new
version of Arachne, you can also easily install all your APMs from previous versions of Arachne.
Just open the APM files in Arachne to do this (Desktop -> Utilities -> Install Arachne Package).
<P>

Warning: Although the Arachne Package Manager makes all changes
very carefully, we recommend that you back up your configuration files (.CFG)
before installing any APM package. We are also planning to implement an uninstall
feature later.
