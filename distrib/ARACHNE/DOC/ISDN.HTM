Subject: solved: Arachne and ISDN

Hi,

after hunting for ages on the net and trying dozens of strange
programs, finally I got Arachne working with the ISDN card.
To help other users which also want to use Arachne with ISDN,
I suggest that you mention on the Arachne homepage and/or
documentation, that Arachne CAN be used with ISDN. To dial up
the provider, the program UKA_PPP is required which can be found at:

That's it, keep up the great work.
