BTW, Michael, my PCI modem works fine with Miniterm/Arachne 1.64. This
modem is set on IOPORT D800, IRQ 10 by the BIOS, and all I have to do is
insert these numbers in PPP setup. I have PNP Operating system set to "No"
in the BIOS.

This e-mail indicates that it is possible to use PCI (=non ISA) internal modems
with Arachne if they are not Winmodems. You (probably ?) have to disable
Plug'n'Play for the requested IRQ in BIOS, and you have to set up Arachne to use
"non-standard serial device" and manually enter the parameters of your PCI modem
(in this case it is Irq 10, Base 0xd800, but of course it will be different
for other modems). However, I haven't tested any PCI modem with DOS Arachne
myself.
