<H1>Arachne as offline HTML viewer</H1>
<HR SIZE=4>
If you are using a DOS file manager (like Norton Commander, Volkov
commander, Dos Navigator, etc.) you would probably like to view local
.HTM files the same way as you view .GIF, .JPG, .TXT or .DOC files -
just by clicking on the name of the file with a mouse.
<P>
It is better to start Arachne in its home directory and you MUST run
ARACHNE.BAT - not only CORE.EXE.
You can use <A HREF="file://doc/lan.htm">multiple configuration files</A>,
in different directories, for example on a LAN. See the description of Arachne
<A HREF="file://doc/dir.htm">configuration and system files</A> to understand Arachne's
configuration files - it's generally possible to add the Arachne directory to
the DOS PATH and run ARACHNE.BAT from any directory, but the file
<A HREF="file://arachne.cfg">ARACHNE.CFG</A> must <A HREF="file://options.htm">
be set up</A> to contain full path names in some variables, and even with
this, there can be problems with plug-ins, with runtime configuration
files, and temporary files in various locations on the disk, etc.
So it is much better to change the directory before running Arachne.
You can also use some kind of PUSHDIR and POPDIR command (it can even be a
batch file)
<P>
The following example is for Arachne installed in the C:\ARACHNE\ directory:
<UL>
<LI>In <B>Norton commander</B> and it's clones, like Volkov commander, etc.,
choose "Extension file edit". Add the following line:
<P>
<CODE>HTM: C:\ARACHNE\VIEWER.BAT !\!.!</CODE>
<P>
All you have to do now is to copy ARACHNE.BAT to a file called VIEWER.BAT, and
add the following two lines at the begining of VIEWER.BAT:
<P>
<CODE>c:<BR>
cd \arachne
</CODE>
<BR>
<LI>In a powerful Russian file manager called <B>Dos Navigator</B>,
<B>&lt;COMMERCIAL&gt;</B>
DN is becoming quite popular among DOS users all around the world.
It allows you to view, copy, move and delete files in
ARJ, ZIP, RAR and other archives as if they were located in normal
directories; and it allows you to play Tetris just using the &lt;Alt+F9&gt;
hotkey! This is my small apology to the authors of Dos Navigator that
I haven't registered it yet ;-) <B>&lt;/COMMERCIAL&gt;</B>
select "Options","Extension file edit" and simply add the following lines:
<P>
<CODE>
htm{<BR>
 pushdir </CODE>(optional, see source for PUSHDIR.BAT below)<CODE><BR>
 c:<BR>
 cd \arachne<BR>
 arachne.bat !\!.!<BR>
 popdir </CODE>(optional)<CODE><BR>
}
</CODE>
<P>
You don't have to create any special batch file when using Dos Navigator.
<BR>
<I>Note: the '{' character must be placed on the same line as the extension
'htm'.</I>
</UL>
<P>
Here is an example of PUSHDIR.BAT, which can be used to store current
the DOS directory. In the example, we assume directory C:\TOOLS exists and
that it is included in an enviroment variable PATH. File C:\TOOLS\CD.0 must
contain string "cd ", it means exactly three characters: c, d and space
(0x20). No end of line (0x0D, 0x0A).
<P>
PUSHDIR.BAT creates command POPDIR.BAT, which can be used to restore
the current working directory.
<P>
<CODE>
@cd>c:\tools\cd.1<BR>
@copy c:\tools\cd.0+c:\tools\cd.1 c:\tools\popdir.bat>NUL
</CODE>
