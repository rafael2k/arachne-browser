What is NetDOS ? Nothing more than the normal executable DOS files, i.e., 
*.COM or *.EXE, which can be downloaded from the internet and executed if 
the URL is listed in <A HREF="file://security.cfg">SECURITY.CFG</A>.
<P>
It may sound silly to try to put DOS executables online, but think
about it: they are usually very small, very fast, and they can run on a wide variety
of platforms. Of course there is a problem with security. I tried to overcome
this by allowing download of NetDOS executables only from trusted URLs. And
there are specific applications (like for an Intranet), where security is not
so important and where executables are being downloaded from the
server all the time. And you should also consider the fact that ALL programs 
that you download from the Internet, with the exception of Java applets, are 
executables: if you run them, you have already decided to trust their authors. 
In any case, executing programs is hazardous only in a single-user system, 
like plain DOS; if you are running some DOS emulator (like DOSEMU under Linux), 
it can be configured to be as secure as a Java virtual machine.
<P>
I chose the following MIME types for *.EXE and *.COM files:<BR>
<B>application/x-netdos-exe</B> and <B>application/x-netdos-com</B>.
<P>
Suggested file extensions on the server side are <B>.netdos-exe</B> and
<B>.netdos-com</B>. A simple .exe or .com would be misleading, since normal
DOS programs are not expected to be executed after download is completed.

You can try the NetDOS scheme by downloading several short (4KB) ASM demos
from the <A HREF="http://home.arachne.cz/netdos/">NetDOS homepage</A>
(but only if you are online).
