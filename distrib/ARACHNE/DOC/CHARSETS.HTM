<H1>Using European character sets</H1>
<HR Size=4>
<H3>0. Do you need to read this ?</H3>
If you are using Arachne only to read web pages in English
and/or to send and receive e-mails written in English, you are very
lucky - you don't have to worry about this stuff.

<H3>1. Fonts</H3>
Basic font sets for Arachne are available as
<A HREF="apm.htm">Arachne Packages</A>. There are three basic packages
available: ISO-8859-1 (USA, Western Europe), ISO-8859-2 (Central Europe),
Windows-1251 or KOI-8-R (Cyrillic), ISO-8859-8 (Hebrew).
<P>
You can create your own fonts set from Windows TTF fonts using the TTF2FNT
utility.
<H3>2. Keyboard</H3>
You can use any DOS keyboard driver you wish, but you must tell
Arachne which ISO-8859-x (or Windows-12xx...) characters should
be displayed after typing accented letters on your keyboard.
<P>
This is very easy - just fill in the translation table on the
<A HREF="file://system/gui/opt_loc.ah">Options | Local settings</A> screen:
<BR>1. Turn on your TSR keyboard driver (from DOS command line)
<BR>2. Install requested font set to Arachne.
<BR>3. Deactivate any existing keyboard map and restart Arachne.
<BR>4. Press corresponding key for each accented letter you have on your keyboard.
<I>Important: you shouldn't see correct characters in the input field! If you
see them, it means that you don't have to use a keyboard map!</I>
<BR>5. Press any dummy key (e.g., dot - '.') for each unused accented letter.
<BR>6. Save and activate new keyboard map and then restart Arachne.

<H3>3. Getting the correct charset</H3>
A properly configured web server will send you the document in your
local charset if the browser sends the HTTP keyword "Accept-charset".
APM packages configure this keyword automaticaly but you can check
it at <A HREF="file://system/gui/opt_loc.ah">Options | Local settings</A> screen.

<H3>4. Receiving e-mails</H3>
All "Content-type:" lines in MIME headers are converted to
&lt;META HTTP-EQIV="Content-type" ...&gt; tags - see paragraph 6 below.
Of course, for most e-mails you won't need any conversion tables,
because ISO-Latin-1 and ISO-Latin-2 encodings are standards for
Internet e-mail exchange and they are (more or less) accepted even
by Microsoft.

<H3>5. Sending e-mails</H3>
You have to use either 8bit or quoted-printable encoding
(see <A HREF="file://system/gui/opt_net.ah">Options | Network settings</A>) for outgoing
e-mail, and you also have to specify your character set correctly
(see <A HREF="file://system/gui/opt_loc.ah">Options | Local settings</A>).


<H3>6. &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-type" ...&gt; tag</H3>

You only need a 256byte-long translation table of your current
character set (these tables are included in APM packages with fonts). 
And fortunately, Microsoft FrontPage is able to automaticaly insert this tag into 
HTML pages! Some Apache modules, which convert encoding to encoding-requested-
by-browser, are even able to automaticaly alter the content of this tag when
sending a page. Example:<P>

<TT><B>&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=X-Y"&gt;</B></TT>
<P>
<TABLE BORDER>
<TH>X-Y
<TD>Arachne will read conversion table from file
<TR>
<TH><TT>windows-1250</TT>
<TH><TT>SYSTEM\CODEPAGE\1250.cp</TT>
<TR>
<TH><TT>iso-8859-2</TT>
<TH><TT>SYSTEM\CODEPAGE\8859-2.cp</TT>
<TR>
<TD>etc.
</TABLE>

<H3>7. Specifying charset in HTTP header</H3>
Works the same way as &lt;META&gt; - see below. The syntax of the HTTP header is:
<P>
<TT><B>Content-type: text/html; charset=X-Y</B></TT>

<H3>8. Printing</H3>
For ASCII printing, you can configure some additional encoding filter
in your MIME.CFG file - on lines "file/print.dgi" and "file/printcom.dgi".
PostScript printing of non-ISO-Latin-1 and  documents is not yet
implemented, but it appears there is a solution which will
be used in future.
