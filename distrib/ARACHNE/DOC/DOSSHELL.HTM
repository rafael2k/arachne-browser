You can boot ARACHNE within DOSSHELL, if the autoexec.bat file
contains

SET ARACHNE=vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
SET ARACHNETEMP=vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
SET MYIP=vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
SET REMIP=vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
SET NETMASK=vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
SET PEERMRU=vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv

This allocates environment space before entering DOSSHELL. Then all
is fine. (But, do not use task swapper!)
