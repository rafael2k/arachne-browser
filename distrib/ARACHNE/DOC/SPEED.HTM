<H3>Quick tips</H3>
<OL>
<LI> Arachne needs at least a 386 CPU with 4 MB of RAM to do anything useful.
<LI> Enable at least 1 MB of standard XMS memory or at least 512 KB of EMS.
<LI> Both read and write disk caching is REQUIRED
<LI> Let your <A HREF="tempdir.htm">TEMP environment variable</A> point to 
your RAM disk and <A HREF="..\system\gui\opt_loc.ah">use it for local 
caching</A>.
<LI> Disable all obsolete visual effects using 
<A HREF="..\system\gui\opt_misc.ah">Preferences screen</A>.
</OL>

<H3>More details</H3>
<OL>
<LI>Make sure your %TEMP% environment variable points to an existing directory
on your fastest disk drive - cf. also
<A HREF="tempdir.htm"> notes on configuring the TEMP directory</A>.
This is extremely important if you chose swapping to disk. 
The minimum size of such a RAM disk is 512 KB.
<LI>If you are using HIMEM.SYS, make sure that the "numhandles=xx" argument
is present on the HIMEM.SYS line in your <A HREF="file:c:\config.sys">config.sys</A>
file. "xx" should be some suitable number, let's say 64 (?). When using the
QEMM memory manager (recommended), you won't have this problem but when
Arachne crashes and restarts without deallocating XMS, the perfomance
may suffer. It is better to reboot your PC in such case.
<LI>Try to keep the number of files in the Arachne working directory 
fewer than 128
<LI>Disable smooth scrolling, smooth Page Up/Page Down,
and virtual screen, or try to select values appropriate for adequate computer
performance (you can use <A HREF="file:..\system\gui\opt_misc.ah">Preferences screen</A>
to do this).
<LI>Disable frames
<LI>Disable logo animation
<LI>Use SMARTDRV (NWCACHE in OpenDOS).
Make sure that you are also using disk-write caching,
not merely something like "SMARTDRV /X" (default setting in AUTOEXEC.BAT on
many systems), but rather "SMARTDRV C+"
<LI>There are reports that Arachne is "ultrafast" on most systems if 
you run it from a 2-3 MB RAM disk (a RAM disk can be configured in the 
DOS CONFIG.SYS file).
A <A HREF="file://aramdisk.txt">Detailed explanation</A> on how to fit Arachne 
even onto a small RAM disk was written by Clarence Verge, a longtime Arachne 
user. If your RAM disk is not big enough for Arachne, try at least to
point your %TEMP% environment variable to it - Arachne uses it for some
temporary files. It can be more efficient than using the memory as XMS/EMS.
<LI>In a multitasking environment (like Windows 95) try to run Arachne in
single-task ("MS-DOS") mode.
<LI>If it is possible, select your SVGA card directly and do not use the VESA
driver. VESA calls are approximately two times slower than direct access
to some older SVGA cards (like Trident or TSENG). Another solution is
to use UNIVBE VESA driver, available at
<A HREF="http://www.scitechsoft.com/">http://www.scitechsoft.com/</A>
BTW: some VESA implementations slow down Arachne so much, that it runs 
slower on the Pentium at the school lab than on my 386 at home.
<LI>Turn off local icons and turn on fast JPEG preview in "More options"
Local surfing and JPEG conversion is also faster if there is
enough DOS memory available to spawn the external utilities without leaving
Arachne.
<LI>Switch off image loading.
You can load individual images by clicking on them with the right mouse button.
If you really need real-time response, you can use the ~ (tilde) key to 
temporarily turn off all graphics.
Or, if you still want to see images, set the image refresh time to 60 seconds 
(both in "More options").
<LI>Delete files like <A HREF="..\PPP_BACK.GIF">PPP_BACK.GIF</A> or
<A HREF="..\PAPER.GIF">PAPER.GIF</A>, especially in EGA mode.
<LI>Use a lower resolution to see fewer images at a time. It will speed up
palette mixing. It appears that VESA mode 640x400x256 colors is
extremely fast. 
<LI>Using HiColor modes slows down the graphics output but no palette
mixing is required.
<LI>Try background surfing (hold Ctrl while clicking on link). You can
comfortably read the current document until a new one is downloaded. When 
the download is finished, click the link again and the document will appear 
immediately.
<LI>Surf quickly (without reading) to disk cache, then disconnect the modem 
(Alt+H) and browse documents from <A HREF="..\UTILS.HTM">Utilities</A> (U) -&gt;
<A HREF="file://cacheindex.dgi">Cache Index</A>.
In some countries, like the Czech Republic, this can also help you to reduce
your phone bill.
<LI>Try to delete disk cache (with the F8 key) when the computer seems to be 
too slow. Searching cache for missing images and writing the cache index to disk
both take a lot of time.
<LI>Ask your Internet provider or LAN administrator if there is a proxy
server available. Proxy caches frequently accessed WWW pages (like Netscape
homepage, Altavista or Yahoo queries, etc.).
<LI>Buy a faster modem or computer or select a faster Internet provider...
