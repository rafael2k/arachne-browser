<H1>How to set up a temporary directory for Arachne</H1>
<HR SIZE=4>
1. the prefered location for a temporary directory is the RAM disk (or at least
any drive with enabled disk caching)
<BR>2. do not use the root directory of any drive
<BR>3. make sure the directory is created by your AUTOEXEC.BAT
<BR>4. define an environment variable called TEMP (most DOS compatible systems
define this variable for you)
<BR>5. do not use an additional backslash ("\") at the end of the pathname
<BR>6. if necessary, you can define an ARACHNETEMP environment variable
which overrides the TEMP setting for Arachne
<BR>7. for best performance, enable caching of local objects to the TEMP
directory in <A HREF="file://system\gui\opt_loc.ah">Options | Local settings</A>
<BR>8. the amount of free disk space on the drive where the TEMP directory is located 
should be at least 512 KB, but the recommended size is at least several MB.
<H3>Example of lines which should be present in your AUTOEXEC.BAT:</H3>
<PRE>SET TEMP=G:\TEMP
MKDIR %TEMP%</PRE>
