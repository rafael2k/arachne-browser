<H1>Using Arachne profiles and scripts</H1>
<HR Size=4>
<H3>ACF - Arachne Configuration Files</H3>

ACF files are simply copies of the ARACHNE.CFG file. Once you configure 
and fine-tune Arachne for some Internet provider, you can create two
copies of the ARACHNE.CFG file each containing a different user name,
e-mail address, POP3 account, signature, mail directory, hotlist, etc.
Or you can use two ACF profiles for two different providers but both
with the same personal information. 
<P>
ACF files are maintained using a special <A HREF="file://system/gui/profiles.ah">Profile Manager</A>,
accessible, for example, from the Desktop | Options page or from the PPP dialer screen.

<H3>ASF - Arachne Script Files</H3>

ASF scripts are just lists of URLs to visit, nothing more. 
You can create scripts using any text editor...
For example:
<TABLE BORDER>
<CAPTION>MYSCRIPT.ASF</CAPTION>
<TD>
<PRE>
arachne:dialer
smtp:
pop3:
reload:http://arachne.cz/
reload:http://slashdot.org/
arachne:hangup
reload:file://inbox.dgi
file:d:\mp3\wakeup.mp3
file://inbox.dgi
</PRE>
</TABLE>

The special prefix "reload:" tells Arachne to always reload a specified URL;
without this prefix, Arachne would use the cached copy of the object (if available).
An example: launching of MP3 file playback.  To do that, 
you have to install some plug-in capable of playing MP3 files (e.g.,
QuickView or XTC-player), and the MP3 file included in the
script must exist of course.
<P>
To start an ASF script, open it in Arachne: <A HREF="file://*.asf">*.asf</A>.
A typical Arachne screen from which you can launch scripts is the 
<A HREF="arachne:dialpage">PPP dialer screen</A>.
<P>
Arachne currently doesn't offer any tool for creating ASF scripts (with
the exception of "Request all links" and "Audio playlist" features - but
they don't produce user-editable scripts). 
You are expected to use some external ASCII text editor. If necessary, you 
can use <A HREF="file://system\gui\quickpad.ah">QuicKpad</A> to write 
a script file and save it to file with an .ASF extension using the Ctrl+W hotkey.
