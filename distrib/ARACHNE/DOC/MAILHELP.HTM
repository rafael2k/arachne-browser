<H1>Using Insight e-mail</H1>
<HR Size=4>
The Arache e-mail client is called "Insight" - because of its main competitor,
called "Outlook" ;-)
<P>
The easiest way to set up Insight is using the <A HREF="file://system/gui/wizarda.ah">e-mail setup wizard</A>.
<P>
More advanced users can go
to the <A HREF="file://options.htm">options page</A>. You should correctly
set up the SMTP and POP3 server name in the <A HREF="file://system/gui/opt_net.ah">network
settings section</A>, timezone and mail directory in the
<A HREF="file://system/gui/opt_loc.ah">local settings section</A>, and fill in your
personal information and mail transfer preferences in the
<A HREF="file://system/gui/opt_pers.ah">personal settings section</A>.
Another option is to edit <A HREF="file://arachne.cfg">ARACHNE.CFG</A>
- Arachne's plain text configuration file.
<P>
Once the e-mail is configured, you can use the
<A HREF="file://mail.htm">Insight</A> graphical interface to compose, send,
receive, and read messages and files. You can send mails using a <A HREF="mailto:">
mailto</A> type of URL. You can e-mail all displayed documents by just
pressing the &lt;F2&gt; key and send other files by just clicking on their
icons in directory listings.
<H3>Address book</H3>
Many Arachne testers were confused by the absence of an addressbook. 
Arachne does not have an e-mail-only addressbook: however, the Arachne Hotlist
can contain any valid URLs, including the <A HREF="mailto:">mailto:</A>
kind - also known as e-mail addresses. If you select a
mail address with the right mouse button and click on "Add to hotlist" (or
press hotkey "A"), you will be asked to edit the hotlist item name -
which is usually the name of the person you are adding to your hotlist.

<H3>Sending messages</H3>
You can use multiple e-mail addresses in the To: or CC: fields. You can
separate them using one of the following characters: <B>, ; + : </B>.
<P>
When composing an e-mail message, you don't have to specify the e-mail
addresses of recipients manually from the keyboard. You can also use  
<B>@filename</B> in the To: or CC: field which allows you to use a list 
of e-mail address stored in a local file. No special formating is needed: 
it should be a plain text file with one valid e-mail address on each line.
<P>
You can choose two ways to submit each e-mail: send it immediately
to the Internet (if you are online), or save it on your disk in
the OUTBOX folder. In the second case, the message will actually leave 
your computer after clicking on the <B>Send unsent mail</B> icon in the 
<A HREF="file://mail.htm">Insight page</A> (of course, you must be online 
to perform the upload). If you choose to send the mail when you are offline, 
the message will be saved to OUTBOX.

<H3>Folders</H3>
Received mail is stored in folders. Folders are simply subdirectories
of your main mail directory. If you want to create, rename or remove them,
just create, rename or remove the directory. 
You can do this using your DOS file manager
- try <A HREF="file://doc//apm.htm">Arachne Packages</A> VC.APM or DC.APM
if you don't have any file manager yet.
Folders are listed in alphabetical order. 
<P>
You can easily move received messages from
one folder to another. New messages (in INBOX), archived ones, and sent
ones have a "Move" button which allows you to move them to an existing 
folder or even to create a new folder and immediately move the message there.
The "Trash" button is a shortcut for moving messages to the TRASH folder, and
"Archive" is for moving them to the ARCHIVE folder.
<P>
<I>Tip: to quicky delete an unwanted message from a folder, select it with
the right mouse button (or Shift+Enter) and press Delete.</I>
<P>
<B>e-mail Messages</B> are stored on your disk as normal text files - 
the following table explains the extensions:
<TABLE BORDER>
<TD>*.CNM<TD>New mail (Compatibility: Pegasus mail for DOS on Novell networks)<TR>
<TD>*.MES<TD>Received mail - stored in folders (we avoided *.MSG because
this extension is used for messages in the Fidonet netmail directory, which
uses proprietary binary headers)<TR>
<TD>*.TBS<TD>"To Be Sent" - outgoing mail<TR>
<TD>*.SNT<TD>Sent mail
</TABLE>

<H3>More tips &amp; tricks</H3>
While viewing an e-mail message, you can easily rename it and copy it to another
directory using the &lt;F2&gt; key. You can use any filename you wish, but
it is recommended to keep the *.CNM extension, so that Arachne or, for example,
Pegasus mail for DOS can recognize the files later. The &lt;F2&gt; key is 
another way to forward an e-mail message exactly as it is - most e-mail
clients will recognize such an attachment.
<P>
In case that you don't want your POP3 password to appear in the
<A HREF="file://ARACHNE.CFG">ARACHNE.CFG</A> file, you have to enter the password
into the input field in the top left corner of the
<A HREF="file://mail.htm">Insight page</A> and press the <B>Accept</B> button each time you restart Arachne.
<P>
You can also download mail by giving the following URL to Arachne:
<BR><B>pop3://username:password@server</B>
<P>
If you want to transfer e-mail to more mailboxes and/or send and receive
e-mail at the same time, you can use <A HREF="acf_asf.htm">Arachne script
files</A>.
