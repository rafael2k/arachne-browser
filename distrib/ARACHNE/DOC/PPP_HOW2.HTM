<H1>How to use Arachne with PPP or SLIP</H1>
<HR SIZE=4>
The easiest way to use Arachne with a PPP connection is to configure
Arachne using the <A HREF="file://system/gui/wizard1.ah">Arachne PPP Wizard</A>.
<HR>
Arachne uses a DOS packet driver interface to enable TCP/IP connectivity.
This technology is not very simple to understand, but it's the only standard
DOS presently offers.
The packet driver is a resident program (TSR) similar to utilities
like a mouse driver or a VESA driver. TCP/IP applications access the packet
driver using a software interrupt - usually it is 0x60 (60H). The packet driver
for an ethernet card (LAN) is a small freeware program (with a name like ODIPKT.COM, 
or similar).
If you are using a dial-up connection, you need a TSR program to "emulate"
the ethernet card packet driver.
<P>
The following ways to connect to the Internet via serial line (modem) from 
DOS are known:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#dospppd">DOSPPPD</A> - a port of the Unix PPP daemon to DOS enviroment.
Best choice, <B>included in distribution package</B>
<LI><A HREF="#klos">Klos PPP</A> - a shareware PPP dialer from Klos Technologies.
Arachne can auto-configure itself to support it, but due to it's license,
it cannot be distributed with Arachne.
<LI><A HREF="#ether">EtherPPP</A> - This was the original freeware packet driver
distributed with Arachne, but it is no longer directly supported or included
in the distribution package.
<LI><A HREF="#slip">UMSLIP</A> - the SLIP driver from Univesity of Minnesota.
Reported to work with Arachne. Not included in distribution package.
<LI><A HREF="#slip">SLIPPER, CSLIPPER</A> - SLIP
(=Single Line Internet Protocol) and CSLIP
(=compressed SLIP) programs.
CSLIPPER.EXE is <B>included in distribution package</B>.

</UL>

<HR>
<A NAME="dospppd">

<H3>DOSPPPD</H3>
DOSPPPD is a single program - <B>EPPPD.EXE</B>. Arachne will load
DOSPPPD if the <A HREF="file://ARACHNE.CFG">ARACHNE.CFG</A> file contains 
the following line:
<B>Connection @EPPPD.EXE</B>.
<P>
DOSPPPD is a port of the Unix PPP daemon to the DOS enviroment.
It's probably the best PPP solution available in DOS.
It consumes less memory than EtherPPP or KlosPPP.
The author of this DOS port, Toni Lopez, permitted me to include this 
dialer in the Arachne package.
<P>
If you don't want to use the Arachne built-in configurator, you can study the
<A HREF="file://dospppd.txt">DOSPPPD documentation</A>, which was created by
merging files README.TXT and PPPD.MAN from the DOSPPPD package.
You don't need to worry about how to connect because Arachne uses its
own dialer - <B>MINITERM.EXE</B>, configured in
<A HREF="file://arachne.cfg">ARACHNE.CFG</A>.
The IP address is passed by option <B>IP_Address PPP</B>.
<P>
If you are not an advanced DOS user, I suggest using the
<A HREF="file://system/gui/wizard1.ah">Arachne PPP wizard</A> previously
mentioned. More details (eg. automatic login script) can be entered using 
the <A HREF="file://system/gui/conf_ppp.ah">manual PPP setup screen</A>. 
Just fill in the correct values, click <B>Ok, save</B> and then restart Arachne. 
Arachne will automatically create a configuration file <B>PPPDRC.CFG</B> for DOSPPPD.
<P>
If you prefer to set up text-mode configuration files rather than using
the setup screen, please read 
<A HREF="file://keywords.txt">List of all keywords</A> used in the
<A HREF="file://arachne.cfg">ARACHNE.CFG</A> configuration file.
<HR>
<A NAME="ether">
<H3>EtherPPP</H3>
EtherPPP is a single program - <B>PPP.EXE</B>. Arachne will load
EtherPPP if the <A HREF="file://ARACHNE.CFG">ARACHNE.CFG</A> file contains 
<B>Connection @PPP.EXE parameters>PPP.LOG</B>.
<P>
You have to study the EtherPPP documentation and manually create a
CONFIG.PPP file needed by EtherPPP. You don't have to worry about DIAL.PPP,
as you can use the MINITERM dialer shipped with Arachne.
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="klos">
<H3>Klos PPP</H3>
Klos PPP is a shareware PPP dialer distributed by Klos technologies.
<P>
You must get an uncrippled self-extracting archive <B>pppshare.exe</B>, available at
<A HREF="http://www.klos.com/">http://www.klos.com</A>. The license agreement
doesn't allow us to include this archive directly in the Arachne package.
Place <B>pppshare.exe</B> into Arachne directory and execute it.
<P>
Klos PPP consists of more than one driver file - I suggest you
read the documentation and add these drivers to your <A HREF="C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT">AUTOEXEC.BAT</A>.
Klos PPP drivers can be loaded into high memory.
<P>
Klos PPP provides the PPPMENU.EXE program as an interface to the PPP dialer. 
After connecting with PPPMENU.EXE, you must select the "Exit PPP connect" menu 
option to exit to DOS (or to Arachne). There is also one more executable you must
run to update WATTCP.CFG. After doing that, your
<A HREF="file://ARACHNE.CFG">ARACHNE.CFG</A> might look as follows:
<P><B>
Connection READY<BR>
IP_Address WATTCP<BR>
TCP_Config WATTCP.CFG</B>
<P>
Probably the easiest way to use Klos PPP is to configure it as a
<A HREF="file://system/gui/conf_lan.ah">resident packet driver</A> (and run
PPPMENU manualy from the command line).

<HR>
<A NAME="slip">
<H3>UMSLIP, SLIPPER.EXE, CSLIPPER.EXE:</H3>
SLIP is an older dial-up protocol which was replaced by PPP.
<P>
You can call any of these packet drivers
as an <A HREF="file://system/gui/conf_ext.ah">external dialer</A> or you can establish 
a connection and make them resident first and then use Arachne exactly the same way as on
<A HREF="lan.htm">Local Network</A>. Freeware SLIP programs can be found
on many anonymous FTP sites. CSLIPPER.EXE is included in the Arachne distribution
package.
<P>
I have been told that UMSLIP correctly emulates BOOTP.
