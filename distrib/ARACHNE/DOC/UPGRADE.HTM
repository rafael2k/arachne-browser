<H1>How to upgrade Arachne</H1>
<HR Size=4>
There is currently no user friendly way to upgrade the Arachne WWW browser.
It is strongly recommended that you always install a new release of Arachne 
to a new directory, keeping your old installation as your back-up copy.
If you need to save disk space, try to
<UL>
<LI> delete all files in the old Arachne's CACHE subdirectory.
<LI> use some archiving utility (ZIP, ARJ, RAR, etc.) to pack files in
the old Arachne's directory. After unpacking, your backup copy of Arachne
should work again.
</UL>
<P>
Generally you can try to copy files with extension <A HREF="file://*.cfg">.cfg</A>
from your previous installation to the new one, but be careful with
file <A HREF="..\mime.cfg">mime.cfg</A> since the new one may describe <A HREF="..\dgi.txt">
DGI applications</A> required by the new installation of Arachne. 
It is a good idea to reinstall all <A HREF="apm.htm">APM packages</A>
when upgrading Arachne - they will update the new MIME.CFG automaticaly.
You will probably also want to use your old bookmarks, i.e., the <A HREF="FILE:..\hotlist.htm">hotlist.htm</A> file.
Files in the MAIL subdirectory can be simply moved to the new mail directory,
or you can use a common mail directory for all installations of Arachne on
your PC (something like c:\mail\)
<P>
If you have decided to overwrite your existing application using the Arachne
self-extracting installer, you will find your old .cfg files and
the hotlist in a subdirectory of the new Arachne installation directory called 
<A HREF="file://backup\*.*">backup\</A>.

<B>The format of the mail directory was changed in 1.45 beta: </B>
Received messages (*.MES files) are now stored in subfolders of your
mail directory. This means you have to create a new directory (called,
let's say, OLD\) in you current mail subdirectory, and copy all *.MES
files to this subdirectory. Keep *.CNM, *.TBS and *.SNT files
in the main mail directory.
