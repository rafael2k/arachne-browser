Subject: Don't forget that....

...you can comfortably move all urgent messages about what should be done
to this folder and forget about them forever. Isn't that cool ? ;-)

Well, or course, setting your homepage to file://mail\urgent\*.mes will
slightly improve your chance to return to these messages later...
