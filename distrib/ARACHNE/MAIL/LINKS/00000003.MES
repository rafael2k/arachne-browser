Subject: Why mail reader has to be also web browser...

Do you receive lot of e-mails with URLs in the body of the message ?
Writing URLs on little pieces of paper used to be cool... but I guess
that today you are rather sending e-mails with interesting links to
yourself, if you are not browsing from your own system ;-)
