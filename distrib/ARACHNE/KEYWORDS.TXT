153 Arachne Keywords, Allowed Values and Ranges: with some explanation.
                                                        Last updated 02/07/12
General Information:
            The HEADINGS in Arachne.cfg are IGNORED by Arachne.
            Unrecognized or bogus keywords are also IGNORED.
            The CASE of both the keyword and value is IGNORED.
            Keywords may appear or be placed under any heading
            that helps in the visual or mental organization.
            The ORDER of keywords is irrelevant except where the
            same keyword appears more than once. Then it is the
            first occurrence that takes precedence.
            Where the value assigned to the keyword can be a list,
            it is safe to separate items by a comma.
            Default value for undefined keywords is NUL or 0.

Portability:
            Some of the values are recognized only by Linux version of
            Arachne, some are valid only for DOS version.

Convention: Range of allowed argument is shown literally, or as
            alternatives separated by "|" or as "[]" which must
            be replaced by the text or numbers described by the
            contents of [] and any explanation following in ().
