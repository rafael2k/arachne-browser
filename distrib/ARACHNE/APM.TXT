
How to create Arachne Packages (.APM)
-------------------------------------

An APM file is simply a normal ARJ archive. It is handled by freeware UNARJ.EXE
included in Arachne package. It will be unpacked to the Arachne directory. It
is a good idea to place more complex upgrades to separate directories.

An APM package can contain any Arachne plug-in, DGI script, or patch, for
example, a multimedia player, different font set, or simply just an APM.ID file
with a list of changes to the Arachne configuration files.

The only rule is that an APM package must contain a file called APM.ID with
the following structure:

---cut---
[arachne-package]
[APMicon=URL of package icon (eg. file:ZIP.IKN) - must be on first line!]
Name=name of the package
License=freeware,shareware, commercial, public domain ... GNU, copyright ..
Description=some information about this package
[Description=....more lines]
[Mime=valid MIME.CFG line (MIME type will be replaced or added)]
[Mime=...]
[Icon=valid WWWMAN.CFG line]
[Icon=...]
[Config=valid ARACHNE.CFG line]
[Config=...]
[Overwrite=name of package which is overwritten/deactivated (without .APM!)
[Overwrite=...]
---cut---

You can use HTML tags in the Name, License, and Description variables.

Please send all your public APM packages or information about them to me
(xchaos@arachne.cz), because the *REQUIRED* starting URL for APM packages
is "http://home.arachne.cz/apm/". APMs don't necessary have
to be located there, but this page should be at least a starting point
for Arachne users to find them.

There is a "Find APM" button in the "Save download file" and "Copy file" dialog
boxes; this button uses the CGI script "http://home.arachne.cz/cgi-bin/find-apm"
to locate a suitable APM for a given mime-type file extension.
