1) general info

  LSppp is a small MSDOS PPP packet driver.  It is compatible with the 
  needs of WATTCP and trumpet stacks.  The resident size is approximately
  28K.

  LSppp loads as a class one ethernet driver and handles all 
  aspects of the connection from dialing onward.  Optionally, an external 
  dialer may be used to dial an ISP prior to running LSppp; it will 
  detect the carrier and go immediately into internet communications 
  setup.
  
  LSppp is capable of auto-configuring WATTCP through the bootp mechanism 
  and will do so automatically.  However, for this to work properly LSppp
  will have to be supplied with name server information.  LSppp will 
  attempt to automatically load name server information from the ISP 
  if none is specified on the command line, however, this is an optional 
  feature your ISP may not support.  To see if it is supported run LSppp
  without specifying the name server switch (/N) and see if it places
  DNS addresses in the IP-UP.bat file

  LSppp does not use configuration files; all parameters are placed on 
  the command line or optionally in the LSPPP environment variable.  
  LSPPP will search the environment variable for valid command switches 
  first, then modify this information with command switches specified on 
  the command line.  Configuration options include user name and 
  password, number to dial, nameserver information, and various options 
  to set up a communications port to use or customize the timeout 
  mechanisms.

  The current version does not have a lot of backwards compatability for 
  old versions of the protocols.  If you have problems running it use the
  undocumented /z switch and send the resulting LSPPP.LOG file to the
  author for analysis.  Note that to get a log file you MUST use the /z
  switch; the /l switch is now used for local mode

  Van jacobsen compression and the CHAP protocol have recently been added
  to LSPPP.  Other less used protocols (including MSCHAP) are not 
  currently supported.

  Note that the undocumented /l option has been changed to the 
  undocumented /z option.  Use of the new /l option will in general cause
  internet connections to not work.

3) Configuration

When dialing the modem sends the following configuration string:

ATZ

Also if /dm:# is specified the modem will be told to mute the speaker.

At any time before LSPPP goes resident, you may press 'esc' to end the 
session and hang up.

Configuration options are as follows:

/a:$	set async map
	set an asynchronous control map.  Characters in the map will be
	treated as purely control characters and will be escaped during
	transmission.  For example if the modem uses XON and XOFF you 
	would specify a map of 0x000A0000.  
	The default is a map of zero, meaning no characters are escaped.

/b:$    Comm port

	Set a base i/o port.  For example /b03f8
	default: /b:03f8

/d[r][m][f][l][e]:* Dial [redial] phone number

	Set the phone number to dial.  The redial option is not 
	supported yet.  The 'm' option tells lsppp to mute the speaker.
	The 'f' option forces it to dial even when it thinks it is 
	already connected (useful with winmodems).  The 'l' option
	causes lsppp to initially attempt a terminal-mode login before
	attempting to connect with the PPP protocol.  The 'e' option
	causes lsppp to dial with 'ATX3D' instead of 'ATD', which 
	should be useful in Europe where no dial tone exists.
	 Example:  /d:5551214 
	 Example:  /d:P5551214 this does pulse dialing 
	default: LSPPP does not dial

/h or /?

	Displays the help text

/i      Comm IRQ (0-15) 

	Set the interrupt vector to use
	example : /i:4
	default:  /i:4

/l	Local mode

        Forces LSPPP to not dial (local mode connection)
	Also turns off use of modem control signals

/m:#,#  set MRUs

  sets the maximum recieve unit for both sides of the link.
  The first number is what the number which this client can transmit
  which will be passed to the TCP stack; the second number is the
  amount this client can receive.

  default: /m:576,576

/n:#    Comm port

	Set the com port (1-4).  Automatically sets the /b and /i 
	options based on the setting.

	example: /n:1
	default: /n:1

/p  ppp driver interface

  set the driver to use the native PPP packet interface.  By default
  LSPPP will use the non-native class 1 ethernet interface.  Using the
  native PPP interface has slightly less overhead than using the class 1
  interface, for those TCP stacks that support it.
 
/u      Unload TSR 
	unloads the tsr

/x	xon/xoff

	use the xon/xoff protocol instead of modem control signals

/A:#,#    PAP timeout and count

	Set the timeout and count governing password authentication.  
	The timeout is in seconds and is the time between retries; when 
	count retries have been done LSPPP will give up.  default: 
	/A:3,10

/B:#    Baud rate 
	
	Set the baud rate
	example: /B:57600
	default: /B:19200

/D:#,#,#  Dial timeout & count & delay
	
	Set the timeout and retries for dialing.  This is the time 
	LSPPP will wait for a connection (in seconds) and the number of 
	retries to make before LSPPP gives up entirely.  The third
	parameter is optional and is the number of seconds after 
	dialing before it tries to connect to the ISP.

   default:  /D:45,1,0

/F:#[,#]  UART Fifo buffering

  Set the buffering level of the Uart's receive and possibly transmit 
  fifo (if present).  Valid values for receive fifo are are 1,4,8, and 14.
  If the transmit fifo setting is present, valid values are 1-16

  default: no fifo usage

/I:#,#  IPCP timeout & count 

	Set the timeout and count governing IP configuration.  
	The timeout is in seconds and is the time between retries; when 
	count retries have been done LSPPP will give up.  
	default: /I:3,10


/L:#,#  LCP timeout & count 
	
	Set the timeout and count governing initial link configuration.  
	The timeout is in seconds and is the time between retries; when 
	count retries have been done LSPPP will give up.  
	default: /L:3,10

/M:*    Modem init string
	
	Specify a string to use to initialize the modem when dialing.  
	A typical example is AT&F to initialize defaults.  Note that 
	the dialer will always send ATZ prior to sending the initialize 
	string, which resets the modem.  Also the 'm' parameter on the
	dialer can be used to automatically send ATM0 (mutes the modem)
	in addition to this initialize string

  default:  no initialization string used


/N:@[,@]        DNS address 

	Set the DNS name server address[s].  First address is primary
	and second address is secondary.  If no name servers are 
	specified LSPPP will attempt to auto-configure them from the 
	server.
	example:  /N:198.77.33.2,198.77.33.1
	default: /N:0.0.0.0,0.0.0.0 (autoconfigure)
/P:*    passwd

	Set the login password
	example: /P:truely
	default: no login password

/S:@    Suggest address

        Suggest an IP address for the server to assign to LSPPP
        example: /S:199.62.66.44
        default: no address suggested
        
/U:*    User name

	Set the login user name
	example: /U:dinosaur
	default: user name

/V:$    Packet driver vector

	Set the packet driver vector to use
	example: /V:60
	default: LSPPP searches for a free vector


An example of a valid command line is:

lsppp /dm:5551214 /n:3 /B:57600 /N:101.202.101.4 /U:myname /P:mypass

which uses COM3 to log into an ISP at 57600 BPS with account 'myname' 
and password 'mypass'.  A nameserver is specified and the speaker will 
be muted.

If we had performed the following to set the LSPPP environment 
variable:

set LSPPP=/n:3 /B:57600 /U:myname /P:mypass

Then typing

lsppp /dm:5551214 /N:101.202.101.4

would have the same effect as the first commmand line since LSPPP will 
read the environment varible before reading the command line.  Of 
course you can put the number to dial and nameserver in the environment 
too.

LSPPP will also read from the file LSPPP.CFG which is in the same directory
as LSPPP.EXE.  Format parameters the same as before on as many lines as
you want.
