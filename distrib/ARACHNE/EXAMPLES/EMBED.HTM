<H1>Embedded sound file</H1>
This is an example of a sound file embedded in an HTML page.
Any audio format defined in MIME.CFG can be embedded using the
&lt;EMBED&gt; tag. While the sound is being played, the user can't do
anything else. The situation is better for memory resident MIDI 
players since calling the player will start playback in the background,
whereafter Arachne will restart. In this case, there is a problem with
how to stop the music: one solution is to define a program for unloading
the MIDI player from memory as a DGI script. This is only recommended for 
experienced Arachne and DOS users.

<I>Note 1: it's obvious that this example will work only if 
you have the correct plugin for playing WAV files on your audio device...
<P>
Note 2: this feature is currently available only for local web pages
(file: protocol).
