<td class="menu"><a href="about:">About</a></td>
<td class="menu"><a href="../help.htm">Help</a></td>

This is an example of a stylesheet implementation in Arachne.
You may follow <a class="emph" href="nocss.htm">this link</a> to see how this document looks without
stylesheets - you will also get the same results also if you disable
stylesheet interpretation from Arachne Options | Preferences page.
To see inline CSS source code, just view page source.
Another, <a href="sample.css" class="emph">more complex CSS file</a> is
linked to this page using a &lt;link&gt; tag.

<p class="style2">

This is an example of changing paragraph style. Arachne currently supports
only a few basic attributes, but it is enough for creating several different
pre-defined styles (classes) and switch between them easily. It is
also enough to display <a href="http://www.opera.com/" class="emph">www.opera.com</a>
with more details than with CSS turned off...

<p>
Arachne returns to the default body style when starting a paragraph; I haven't
checked yet if this is MSIE-like behavior or not. The following checkboard
was colored exclusively using CSS:
