
MIME in Arachne
---------------

Arachne supports MIME V1.0 and many extensions to it.

Outgoing binary attachments are encoded using the base64 algorithm, for text
attachments Arachne uses a quoted-printable algorithm. For the eMail body,
you can choose either 7bit, 8bit or quoted-printable encoding -
you can configure this from Desktop | Options | Network preferences.

Multiple files attached to a single message will all be extracted to the
CACHE subdirectory; so if you are sending an HTML page to an Arachne user,
you can easily use relative links like <A HREF="file1.htm"> or
<IMG SRC="file2.gif">, if these files are attached to the same message.

However, Microsoft Outlook uses a more complicated way to link multiple
objects in an eMail message, called "Content-ID". Arachne is currently able
to generate Content-ID, which has the format "arachne-namespace/filename",
so it is easy to create links to such objects. In Version 1.41 beta,
Arachne doesn't support the "cid:" pseudo-protocol which is required to access
these objects (eg. cid:arachne-namespace/mybackground.gif).

The "cid:" protocol will be implemented at a later time.
