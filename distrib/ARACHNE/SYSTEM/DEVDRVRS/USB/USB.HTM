Most drivers starting a <I>"Pop-Up window"</I>, for inform of the presence
of a device connected at USB port, then assign to device a drive letter(i.e. F: )
<BR>
<B>IMPORTANT NOTE:</B>Some drivers like <B>DUSE</B> permitt to remove and
 reconnect the USB DEVICE <U>without</U> reload the CONFIG.SYS.
