<LI>Try to reconfigure your system to offer more conventional DOS memory.
<br>Please take this link to check your<A HREF="reload:file://memc.dgi"> memory stats</A>
<br>In these statisics, look for: "Largest executable program size". 
<br>If the number shown is less than about 500,000 bytes, you need to
free up more conventional memory.
<br><br><LI>Alternatively, you can type the "mem" command from the DOS prompt. 
<br>In this case, the "Largest executable program size" must be at 
least 500,000 bytes. (Since Arachne herself is not yet loaded).
<br>Normally, the best way to free up more memory is to either load 
fewer device drivers in CONFIG.SYS, and/or to use "loadhigh" or "lh" in 
front of the lines that load your drivers.
<br>Remember that the more memory Arachne has, the better she will run.
<br><br><li>See your DOS documentation for more details.
<br><br><LI>With your system configuration as it is, you should probably use Arachne less
extensively - only to view simple HTML pages.
