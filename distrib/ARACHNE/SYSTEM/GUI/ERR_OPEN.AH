<HR SIZE=4>
Arachne was unable to load requested URL.<p>
Possible reasons:
<LI>remote host refused request for connection
<br><small><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(this is the most likely cause and simply hitting 'R' to reload
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the page will most likely load it correctly on the 2nd try)<br><br></b></small>
<small><small><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less likely, but still possible causes....</b></small></small><br>
<LI>remote host doesn't have DNS entry
<LI>remote host cannot be accessed
<LI>packet driver is installed, but network is unreachable.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be caused eg.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by unplugged ethernet cable or lost modem connection.
