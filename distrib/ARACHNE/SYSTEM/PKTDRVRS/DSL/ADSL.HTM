<P>The ADSL box has on its side a USB socket(for connection with a pc on WIN )
 and an RJ45 socket for a ETHERNET CABLE. This for using the ADSL modem on a pc network.
 The RJ45 socket is a professional use connector for PC local area networks.
 It's NOT a simple port like COM or LPT .
 This is cable connection to be used for our DOS ADSL surfing with the aid of an
"Ethernet Card" and a special cable.
<P><FONT size=+1> Now starting ! </font></P>
If your pc has an Ethernet card, take a connection cable like on (A) and go the the step (B).</P>
<P>(A)Take an Ethernet Card and an ethernet connection cable for modem
with<br> <B> 2 RJ 45</B>male connectors at both ends. Remember: the length of this cable make possible to connect the pc and the adsl b
x near the phone socket <B>WITHOUT THE USE OF PHONE EXTENSION CABLE.</B>
Use the best quality cable (shielded cable), to avoid errors during data transfer.
Install the card in the correct PC slot (read user instructions carefully).<br>
<B>DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE THE WINDOWS DRIVERS FOR YOUR ETHERNET CARD !</B>
You can only install a little file called "Dos packet driver".
 <P><FONT size=+1>How to set ARACHNE browser for ADSL</FONT></P>
With an Ethernet connection you can't install any files supplied with the ADSL box. Arachne views the ADSL box like a "network device".
(B)Install the latest version of Arachne and start the setup menu. Choose from the menu: <U> Use BOOTP/DHCP</U>
(With this choice do not specify any ip address).
Return to setup menu and choose "ethernet setup". Arachne detects your ethernet card and modifies autoexec.bat.
The driver installed its very little(few Kb) i.e. NE2000.com.
This file is loaded before starting Arachne. It's a TSR (terminate and stay resident), when started remains in memory and conrol your network card.
<P><FONT size=+1>Arachne doesn't recognize your card ?</FONT></P>
You can make a search on Google for" xxx dos packet driver" , were xxx is the name of ethernet card (i.e." 3c905 dos packet driver ").
