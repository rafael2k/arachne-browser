<ul>
<li>
This is the Arachne survival guide, written by Jake Young.<br>
An essential guide is the list of Hotkeys, accessed by pressing K.<br>
Press the spacebar or PageDown to read down the page.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<li>
Setup options are accessed by pressing O and selecting further pages with<br>
the click buttons on the screen. Don't forget to click "Use New Settings".<br>
For maximum speed, the current setup doesn't download images. Shift+Enter<br>
over an image placeholder will retrieve the image.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<li>
An external modem (not a "WinModem") should be connected to Serial Port 1<br>
(and a phone socket!) for online use. This computer cannot make best use<br>
of a fast modem -- a cheap old 14.4 type would be fine.<br>
Failing that, a faster, (but easier to find) external modem...<br>
but NOT a WinModem!
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<li>
The easyfind.acf (acf = Arachne Configuration File) <u>should</u> allow<br>
Internet access from any location, hopefully enough to manage setting up<br>
an account with another ISP (Internet Service Provider). It should also<br>
allow use of Web-based e-mail e.g. Hotmail, but this will be very slow.<br>
The EasyFind option may drop the connection before you can get much done.<br>
It's strictly a stop-gap solution!
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<li>
An individual ISP account is required to send and receive conventional e-mail.<br>
This Arachne package can easily send/receive (with attachments).<br>
Hotkeys: M for the mail page, C for compose a message.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<li>
A link to a webpage or e-mail address may be added to the Hotlist by<br>
highlighting the link (cursor over link, then Shift+Enter or right-mouseclick)<br>
then press A to add the link. The Hotlist is accessed with the H hotkey.<br>
One to practise on: <a href="c:\arachne\survival.htm">Survival Guide</a>.<br>
Edit the pop-up Title bar!
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<li>
Use Tab and Shift+Tab to move between links; Esc to remove the cursor from<br>
an entry box and return to the page; F3 to open a URL or saved page; G to<br> 
edit the URL entry; F2 to save a page; Spacebar for down; B for up; Backspace<br>
for History (click the links to return to pages); F10 for Desktop; K for more Hotkeys!
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<li>
Press D or Ctrl+LeftArrow ("Back") to return to the Dial page.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<li>
Press Alt+X to exit Arachne.<br>
Press Alt+E to 'shell to DOS'<br>
(when shelled-out, type exit&lt;enter&gt; to come back into Arachne)<br>
</ul>
