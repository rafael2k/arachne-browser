List of keywords in arachne.cfg used for dial-up connections
</FONT>
<P>
In order to support all possible and impossible conditions
of dial-up connections to the internet, Arachne comes with
two different external dialers (lsppp and miniterm).<br>
Lsppp.exe is a dialer/packet driver all-in-one.<br>
Miniterm is a dialer only, and then requires a packet driver.
The packet driver Epppd.exe is included to then be used after
miniterm.exe has dialed.<br>
They are commonly configured with the help of Arachne's
setup-wizards or the option pages. For experienced users who
like to edit the Arachne configuration file arachne.cfg
manually, it might be useful to document which keyword in
arachne.cfg is used by which dial program.
