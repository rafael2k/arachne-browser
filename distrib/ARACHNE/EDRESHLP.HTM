<LI><B> To add someone to E-Dress List:</B> &nbsp; While reading their mail,
click either "Reply" or "Forward"; all the mail handling interfaces will have
the field with E-dress list. &nbsp;Click anywhere on the desired e-mail
address in the "To" field, and copy to clipboard with CTRL-C.&nbsp;  Go to
E-Dress List, place cursor at start of empty line (you can create an empty
line at any location by hitting <Enter> at beginning or end of existing line)
and copy from clipboard with CTRL-V.&nbsp; Then save the updated list with
CTRL-W.&nbsp; The name of the file is E-DRESS.TXT, and you must replace the
default file name in the Quickpad bar with E-DRESS.TXT</LI>

<BR><br>

<li><B> To use E-Dress List:</B> &nbsp;  Place cursor anywhere in the text
area of the list; use F-7 or the slash key [&nbsp;/&nbsp;] to search for
desired name. &nbsp; Then copy to Clipboard with CTRL-C (or highlight using
editor command). Return to message area and place cursor where you want the
e-dress, then copy from clipboard with CTRL-V (or use editor command) to copy
to desired place.</li>

<BR><br>

<li><B> To rearrange or remove listings:</B>&nbsp;  Use editor commands of
your choice, and remember to use CTRL-W to write the updated E-DRESS.TXT

<br><br>
<li><b>To create or transfer an address book:</b>&nbsp;  Any text editor can
be used to create the file E-DRESS.TXT ... If you are transferring an address
book from another browser, simply make certain that you have only a single
name and/or e-mail address per line, and that any html code has been
removed.&nbsp; There is no limit to the number of lines in the E-DRESS.TXT
file, and with the Search function provided via F-7 or slash [&nbsp;/&nbsp;] there is no
need for alphabetizing or special ordering of the entries.</li>
